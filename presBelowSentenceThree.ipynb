Typically, fireworks are fired from metal mortars.  Black powder or other long-burning explosives are packed in the bottom with an electronic ignitor, wired to an electronic control board.  The firework itself consists of a long chemical fuse, a firecracker type explosive core, binder, a paper container, and pieces of metal called \"stars\".  When the lifting charge is ignited, it lights the fuse, which times the firecracker core, allowing the firework to get to altitude.  The center core explodes, dispersing the packaging and igniting the stars.  The position and distribution of the stars within the firework define the shape of the explosion - radial, spherical, pouring effects, smily faces, etc.  Fireworks with tails have an segment that is ignited and burns immediately (or shortly after lift-off) and burns brightly as firework rises (or flakes and burns, like a sparkler or Roman Candle).'}"

This is actually the exact thing he used as an example for his little rule.  Metals will exhibit a vapor pressure and sublimate, but that pressure is extremely small, which means it happens so slowly as to be nearly immeasurable.  Incidentally, a much more noticeable effect is the phenomenon of \"out gassing\".  This is when other elements dissolved in the metal diffuse out of it and into the vaccuum, common examples being Oxygen and Hydrogen (among others of course).  Out gassing is a major problem for people working with vacuum chambers, since these gasses make your vaccuum less perfect when they are expelled to the inside of the chamber.  A common technique is to \"bake\" the chamber by heating it for several hours while evacuated, which actually speeds up out gassing and (hopefully) causes the majority of the gasses to be expelled from the metal and removed slowly by the vaccuum pump, so that subsequent uses of the chamber experience less out gassing.  Coating the inside of the chamber with Tungsten or Titanium, which hold onto some gasses very strongly can also help.</td>\n",

Whether the net effect of citrate ingestion is alkalinization of blood and urine depends on the cation accompanying citrate. If citrate is ingested as citric acid, in which the accompanying cations are protons, the protons neutralize the bicarbonate formed in the liver so that there is no net effect on acid-base status.9 If citrate is in the form of a potassium or sodium salt, virtually all citrate is converted to alkali with no serum bicarbonate titration, leading to systemic alkalinization. Mitochondria can [take up citrate](_URL_1_), but it appears that dietary citrate isn't a significant source for that mechansim</td>\n",

This has probably happened with Saturn, at least (which has rings extending to the Roche Radius, then small, icy moons of the same composition beyond. There are multiple rings present in the situation. The rings are in motion and intercepting each other. The collision of the rings results in a single ring formation.
