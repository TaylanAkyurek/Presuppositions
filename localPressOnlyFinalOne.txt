 The speaker is currently enrolled in a course or program related to the topic mentioned in the sentence. Fishes have a high rate of reproduction. The concept referred to as "nest association" is widely recognized. There are multiple species that lay eggs in the same location. Alloparental care is a widely accepted term in the scientific community. There is a paper available for reading. There exists a parasitic species that relies on a host for reproduction. Egg-guarding is a common behavior among vertebrates. Some reptiles do provide care, but it's not common. Mammals have a higher risk of predators due to their live birth method.

 There is a situation where large masses and small masses are involved. Gravity is directly proportional to mass.
 Fungi have a concept of gender. Fungi have sexes. Fungi have a unique reproductive system that allows for any gender to produce offspring. Fungi were previously thought to have gender. There are multiple locations in the chromosomes that determine an individual's sex. There are many genes that have multiple alleles. Fungi have a distinct and complex system of genetic control that determines their sex. The concept of "mating type" is widely accepted in scientific communities. Fungi with 4 sex states exist in nature. There are only two possible sexes determined by the A and B genes. There are other fungi that have not received one of each. There are multiple types of fungi that exist, including A1B1, A1B2, A2B1, and A2B2. Fungi have mating types with two alleles. There are at least two different types of fungi involved in this mating process. There are many communities with only one allele and one mating type gene. There are many different mating types in the given population. Fungi have a complex system of mating types that is distinct from traditional sexual reproduction. There are various factors that influence the expression of genes related to mating types. A fungi can mate with another fungi that has a different allele at each of the mating type control genes, so with multiple genes and multiple alleles there are 1000s of possibilities as in the example.
 Because of the intermolecular repulsive forces. In its standard state, water is already fairly dense, and the molecules can't really get squeezed much closer together because of the repulsive force resisting atoms/molecules being closer together. You can think of the density of water as relatively high because water molecules have a lot of net cohesive intermolecular attractive forces--because of the dipole and partial charges in a water molecule, it makes the water molecules want to attract to the opposite partial charge on a neighboring molecule, resulting in a strong net cohesive force. They tend to want to stick together. The proximity one water molecule can have to another is a balance of the net attractive and repulsive forces. To get the molecules any closer (by compressing) requires enough energy to defeat the net repulsive force--which is actually quite strong. So it takes a lot of force to compress the molecules closer together to defeat the electrostatic repulsion between atoms and molecules.
 Well, we're the only hominin currently in existence, so yes. As to extinct hominins, our closest cousins (chimpanzees and gorillas) also have social hierarchies, so it's safe to say that it's an ancestral trait.
 Short Answer: Like in the optic nerve, there is some abstraction of information from touch receptors before it enters the BRAIN as stated in the title of this question. However, the information entering the cells in the spine is "pure" and correspond to individual touch receptors. I am assuming by "like in the optic nerve" you are referring to the fact that each photoceptor is not represented by a neuron in the CNS in that retinal ganglion cells (the output cells of the retina) receive input via many photoreceptors via bipolar and amacrine cells that facilitate a degree of visual data abstraction. In response to your question (as you talk about the hand, I am assuming you refer to discriminative somatosensation - "fine touch" that e.g. allows object identification). Cells that detect this type of touch are called dorsal root ganglion cells, that have long axons that have specialised endings, such as Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel disks, Ruffini's and Meissner's corpuscles - these allow the transduction of e.g. the edge of a coin pressing your finger. These axons travel from the finger to the CNS - more specifically to the dorsal root of the grey matter of the spinal cord, where their cell bodies lie. Here they are represented accurately in that each cell body corresponds to one touch receptor . These DRG cells are pseudo-unipolar and have efferent axons that stretch up the white matter (the posterior column) to terminate in a part of the medulla called the cuneate nucleus (in the case of the arm). Here, there are interneurones etc. that allow "cross talk" between neurones, and the data becomes more "abstract" through e.g. lateral inhibition, a process by which a strong stimulus in one area overrides nearby areas due to it's strength, allowing pinpointing of this area. This repeats in higher areas as second order neurones travel from the cuneate nucleus to the Ventral Posterior Lateral area of the thalamus, and then finally to the somatosensory cortex via third order neurones. The somatosensory cortex is divided into four main areas - area 3a is probably the most important for touch; here, while data has been abstracted by processing at the three levels described, action potentials are reserved in specific areas that correspond to specific regions of the body. The other areas are far more complex, and projections to the secondary somatosensory cortex are even more poorly understood; for example neurones in areas 1 and 2 of S1 respond to e.g. edges, moving pinpoints etc. TL;DR - "CNS" i.e. spinal cord receives faithful, topographic information from touch sensors, which is transferred to the brain - the cortex receives relatively topographic information, but single neurones DO NOT correspond to single touch receptors as there is some degree of information spread and convergence before it reaches the brain.
 Yes. This is called genome editing. See [here](_URL_0_) for a recent example of correcting a genetic defect in mice with muscular dystrophy. The basic principle is to use nucleases (DNA-cutting enzymes) that are targeted to specific genetic sequences. You can replace cut pieces of DNA with "corrected" or mutated sequences of your choosing by harnessing a natural process called homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR involves replacement of DNA with other DNA that has a similar but not identical sequence (homology). See [here] (_URL_1_) for a primer on genome editing.
 Here's the simple answer:The double slit experiment for particles is interesting because it demonstrates the wave-like nature of mass. However, that wave like nature is only observable for *really* small things. If you look at the wave function of an electron, the position distribution is large enough that you get an interference pattern in the DS experiment. However, if you calculate the same wave function for a macroscopic object, the position distribution is *very* small. If you were to put that object through the DS experiment, you would see no interference, only a classical result.
 The limitation is the speed of light, but, assuming you had time enough to wait, you could communicate anywhere within the galaxy and anywhere else (e.g., nearby galaxies) which aren't expanding away from us. However, more distant galaxies are expanding from us, and the fact that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating means that some galaxies which we can see today we won't be able to see in the future. They'll run away from us faster than any signals can catch them. I just did a quick calculation and assuming the acceleration continues as it is today, the furthest galaxies which would ever see a signal we sent today are presently 15.7 billion light years away.
 Hi! Atmospheric scientist here. I can explain what people mean when they talk about the "quiet period". The last time the U.S. was hit by a major hurricane (defined as category 3 or higher on the wind-based [Saffir-Simpson](_URL_3_) scale) was [Wilma](_URL_1_) in 2005. The U.S. has been hit by destructive hurricanes since then, including Ike, Irene, and Sandy, but these were all either category 1 or 2 when they made landfall. So the "quiet period of major hurricane activity" that you are referring to is the 11 year period after Wilma during which no hurricane made landfall on U.S. soil *while at category 3+ intensity*. Matthew has also ended a 9 year period with no [category 5 storms in the Atlantic basin](_URL_2_) - the previous cat 5 storm being Felix in 2007. Tropical cyclone activity is very complex. It is influenced by planetary-scale oscillations in climate - e.g., [ENSO](_URL_4_) (El Nino/La Nina), the [Madden-Julian Oscillation](_URL_0_), and some others. Hurricane Matthew is not *in itself* an indicator that we are going to see an increase in tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic in the near future (this year or coming years). You would need to look at the overall conditions that favor hurricane formation (low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, overall heat content in the upper ocean, etc.). The relationship between hurricanes and climate variables is receiving a lot of attention, especially in the future as climate change fucks shit up. That's about the best explanation I can give. After all I don't study hurricanes, I study air quality. Now who wants to hear about ozone formation?!?!? ^Anyone? Edit: added links and did formatting stuff
 It would lack the shock wave created in an atmosphere. Additionally, one of the most structurally destructive parts of a nuke is when air rushes in to replace the air forced away by the explosion. I don't know about radiation and the heat given off, but as for sheer power, it would have less.
 Because the other quantum numbers matter too -- things like baryon number, lepton number, weak isospin, color charge, etc. For all intents and purposes those are all also "charges" (in the sense that they obey relevant conservation laws) that need to sum to zero for the process of annihilation to proceed.
 Can you clarify what you're having trouble with? Are you wondering how you pump a laser diode?
 New species appear at a rate that is convenient for humans. That sounds really weird, but different species are called so because it's useful for humans to classify them as being different. Nature has no inherent or obvious divisions. Depending on who you ask, the definition of species is different. It can be simple as producing viable young or being from a different area, to filling a different ecological niche, to looking different. I'm reminded of a line I heard in my genealogy class, "Everything is the same species as it's mother, up until it isn't."
 Sound is a physical phenomenon that can be measured. The sound level at 8 meters is important for some reason. Higher frequencies are more important than low frequencies in the context of temperature/humidity. There is a problem with air loss that needs to be addressed.
 ok, first of all, let's talk about the common misconception that quantum mechanics refers to the "very small", or that there is a *length* scale at which quantum mechanics holds. This isn't true and cannot be: quantum mechanics has only one fundamental constant, Planck's constant, and it just does not have units of length. It has units of action, or angular momentum. Similarly, there isn't any large length scale at which general relativity starts being important. That's because the two dimensionful constant in GR, which are Newton's constant G and the speed of light c, do not have units of length and cannot be combined to make a length. In general, each of these constants, which are all independent, can give different scales on which you can move independently. Ok, I know this makes very little sense, so let's make a super minimalist example, let's just use c and hbar and forget about G for a moment. c fixes the scale of speeds for relativistic physics. If speeds are much less than c, it's nonrelativistic. If they are of order c (say, v/c = 1/2) then you are in the relativistic regime. hbar fixes the scale of, for example, angular momenta for quantum physics. If ang mom is of order hbar, it's quantum. If it's much greater, it's classical (very roughly). You can choose these two independently, because speed cannot be compared to ang momentum. You get four regimes:v  <  <  c, L  >  >  hbar, classical newtonian mechanicsv ~ c, L  >  >  hbar, classical relativistic mechanicsv  <  <  c, L ~ hbar, nonrelativistic quantum mechanicsv ~ c, L ~ c, relativistic quantum mechanics (aka quantum field theory)Not sure if you see my point. There aren't two extremes at the end of a spectrum, they are two independent orthogonal directions in which you can move. You can add G back in to get a third axis, and then you're left with a graph like this:[cube of regimes](_URL_0_)Ok, so given this cube, what string theory does is it provides a possible (and very appealing, if you ask me) piece of the puzzle to place in the "Theory of Everything" corner. You can get there from the General Relativity corner by moving in the quantum direction (quantizing gravity) or from the QFT corner by moving up in the G direction (adding gravity to QFT, which is essentially the same thing). That's what string theory is: a consistent quantum theory of relativistic gravitation (among many other beautiful things). There isn't "big things", "small things". You can put yourself in the "Theory of Everything" corner, which is just the Planck scale. This does finally define a scale of lengths, namely the planck length, which is built out of G hbar and c as such:l_P = sqrt( hbar G / c^3 )So, if you look at things the size of the Planck length, both general relativity and quantum mechanics should apply, and so you need a theory of quantum gravity. Now, the question of why do we need string theory to do that, that's another thing.
 There are nuclear reactions occurring in the sun that involve particles tunneling through each others Coulomb barriers. Nuclei repel because they’re positively charged, but even if they have a low relative kinetic energy, they can still tunnel in order to react with each other.
 The Roche limit of an object is the distance where a small object, in orbit around the bigger one, is pulled apart by the difference in gravity between the near and far sides. This depends on for example what the small object is made of, see [Wikipedia](_URL_0_) for more info. Black holes cannot be torn apart since they are as far as we know point-like, but they do or can have their own Roche limits. It turns out that for big black hole the gravity changes less quickly than for small ones (I think that's in the /r/askscience wiki), so for big black holes the Roche limit might be inside the event horizons. For smaller ones it's outside the horizon.
 The biggest body you could jump off would be an asteroid or comet not much bigger than [67P, the one with the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae lander. ](_URL_1_) >  Let's assume I'm 180 lbs and can jump 24 inches vertically on Earth. You just made it really easy for me. This tells me the maximum amount of work your legs can do, and by conservation of energy:     m g h = (180 lbs) (9.81 m/s^2 ) (24 inches) is about 500 Joules if you round up a little. Of course, it turns out your mass doesn't matter in a problem like this - it's sort of like Galileo's cannon balls. If you jump on a rocky body with the density of earth, which is about 5.5 g/cc, I can find the potential energy of an object on the surface of that body which is equal to the work you can do with your legs. That imaginary rock is about [2.4 miles, or 4 kilometers across. ](_URL_0_) Unfortunately, bodies of this size don't have enough gravity to pull themselves into a sphere, and are generally potato shaped, so it's hard to find something of this size on a list of known solar system asteroids. But again, [comet 67P,](_URL_1_) where the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae lander are, is quite close. This is why it was kind of a big deal that the lander bounced when it first landed - it would have been very easy for it to bounce off and *never come back. * If you were to have a manned mission to an asteroid of this size, you'd definitely want to be tethered down.
 That two curves approach each other does not imply that their lengths approach each other. You can make a very small zig-zag that approximates a unit line-segment as well as you like, but wiggles fast enough to have an arbitrarily large length. When calculating the length of a smooth curve you need to use the *derivative* of the curve to do it. If the derivatives don't *also* converge to the derivative of the curve of interest then the lengths will in general have nothing to do with each other. Another way of looking at it is just that infinite limits behave badly. This is true in a lot of respects, *especially* with function convergence. If you have almost any function property X (continuous, bounded, differentiable, analytic, integrable, etc. ), you can make a sequence of functions with property X whose limit does not have property X. In this case, you have a sequence of functions, and a corresponding sequence of their lengths. The limit of the sequence of lengths does not have to be at all related to the length of the limit of the sequence of functions. Take sawtooth waves of height 2^(-n) and period 2^(-2n) as steadily 'approximating' the line-segment [0,1]: the lengths will rocket to infinity even as the function itself converges at every single point. Such is life.
 Here's some actual data (from J Aviat Med. 1958 Jun;29(6):433-7. Protection against acceleration forces in animals by immersion in water. MARGARIA R, GUALTIEROTTI T, SPINELLI D.):* 8 out of 10 rats survived a brief acceleration of 1000g while submerged in water, while nearly 100% died during a brief acceleration of 100g without water. * 80% of frogs and fish subjected to 150g for 1 minute lost equilibrium due to detachment of the otolith organ. * Fish died after 24 hours of either 150g or 3000g (the paper is vague) due to an inability to feed. * Erythrocytes were found concentrated in the "lower" half of animals after centrifugation (even live ones). * As for using breathable liquids: rat fetuses were able to withstand brief 10,000g accelerations and develop normally.
 We have a specific name for rock features formed by lightening strikes: [Fulgarites](_URL_0_). Take a look on google images, there's some cool stuff. Lightning can certainly crack individual bits of rock, and fuse or melt things locally, but it's on a very small scale. So while the answer technically is yes, it does cause erosion, the amount is negligible. It would only cause a rockslide if it was the final trigger for an event which had already been developing and would happen anyway.
 lucky for you im studying for an A & PII test right now and my break included reddit! anywho i did a quick keyword search and here are a few things:* muscle contractions are 40% use and 60% heat. * Heat regulation centers are located in the hypothalamus of the brian and reccive inputs from thermo receptors in the brain and from around the body (shell)* vigiours excerscise can cause the muscles to produce 30-40 times more heat than the rest of the body, and can raise the body temprature 3.6'F-5.4'F ^(so assuming your not doing vigorus excerscise any heat contribution caused by shivering will be less than 3.6'F)* of the 4 heat loss mechanisims (Radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation) the combo of conduction and convection can contribute to about 10%-20% of heat loss to the environment ^(your cold dorm hall)* Evaporation by itself can remove large amounts of body heat for every gram of water evaporated about .58Kcal of heat is removed from the body    ^(out of a hot shower and into a cold hall)     ^(a drastic change in body temp caused by convection,conduction and evaporation activates thermoceptors all over the body because you being hot and wet then getting cold and wet could sending a SUPER strong signal to hypothalamus)I have about 10 more pages worth of results, all clearly, explaining the enzyme triggers, and the cascade of events once decrease in temprature is detected but I have to go, my break is over. SORRYTl:DR its less than or equal to 3.6'FEDIT: so i was thinking about this topic again and wondering why you would even shudder if you were already  going to shiver. Then I thought back to the heat loss mechanisms and water evaporating off of the body can remove a fair amount of heat. Sooo, the reason for the intense shudder is to remove the small droplets of water on the skin that are multiplying heat loss. Hence the body is mitigating heat loss. ^(my idea came from seeing a dog shaking off water, funny how that triggered that idea. )
 Most of the magic (or maybe trickery) is in all of the θs in each function, which is Wolfram Alpha's abbreviation for the [Heaviside Function](_URL_1_). Basically, that acts like a toggle. Instead of finding a single curve which precisely draws a shape, they can split up the shape into all of its pieces. Then they find a curve to draw each part - horizontal line, kinda curvy line, vertical line, circle - and use the heaviside function to switch each one on and off. For example, say they want a line at a 45 degree angle from x=0 to x=2. They would start with y=x, which goes to + and - infinity. To bound it between 0 and 2, they would use:[(HeavisideTheta[x] - HeavisideTheta[x - 2]) * x](_URL_0_[x]+-+HeavisideTheta[x+-+2]+%29+x+from+x%3D-5+to+5+and+y%3D-5+to+5)If you start combining dozens or hundreds of these functions, you can draw some very complicated shapes. I'm sure they have an algorithm which does this - breaks an image into small pieces, finds a function for each piece, then combines the pieces into one big function.
 A gas of particles is a very complex system, and each individual particle is experiencing its own unique amount of time dilation (dependent on its velocity and direction). Say you stuck a clock in a gas and then isolated it from the environment, so that its temperature does not increase with the gas (to avoid some issues with material properties of the clock). At 100 K, the time measured by a single particle in the gas (in the particle's rest frame) will not agree with what the clock says, since (as you said) temperature implies the particle is moving. This is time dilation, albeit a very small amount. If you increase the gas to 300 K, the time dilation will be more pronounced since the particles are travelling faster. So yes, if the particles are moving (relative to the clock) then you will notice a very small amount of time dilation. It's important to emphasize that this is between the individual particles and the clock, though - if you were standing next to the clock, you would see no difference since you are in the clock's reference frame.
 Basically, there's a massive galaxy exactly between us and the distant supernova. The gravity of the cluster attracts the light from the supernova, and bends the path of the light towards the earth. [Since light can be redirected by gravity, light from the supernova can end up taking multiple paths to get to us. ](_URL_1_) There's a slight delay because the paths through the cluster have slightly different lengths. That difference in length is only a few light years, so we end up seeing the supernova multiple times over the span of a few years. [For reference, this is the original paper. ](_URL_0_) If I can offer some personal commentary - this is an incredible discovery, and due to the potential for using it to measure the cosmic expansion rate it's definitely worth following up to observe those future supernova.
 Right now the limiting factor is the size of the needle and deposition volume (how much ink is placed in the deeper layers of the skin per puncture). At the cellular level, ink injection can be a little "blurry". The ink is deposited, damaging the epidermis and surrounding layers of skin. The immune system attempts to get rid of the pigment particles, and does so to the surface pigment by flaking it off. But the deeper pigment gets encapsulated by fibroblasts in the collagen matrix ("scar" tissue). I imagine this process leads to some movement/"bleeding" of the different pigments, but I would say not more than a few cell widths' worth.
 weather forecasting. Weather is applied mathematics based on variables, patterns and historic data. Forecast models are only reasonably accurate for about 24 hours. Beyond that, the divergance increases exponentially because the sheer volume of the variable data becomes overwhelming.
 Carbon dating has been calibrated using tree rings, amongst other sources, of known age to calibrate the dating technique. This is necessary as C14 is constantly generated in the upper atmosphere from bombardment of cosmic rays. Other sources which are not generated constantly are calibrated based on the rate of radioactivee decay which is very well known, error of less then 0.1% (a couple million years in a couple billion) is possible. The [wiki](_URL_0_) has lots of great info.
 If you have a graph of a function and then graph it's inverse, then what you will get is the exact same graph, but with the x and y axes mirrored onto each other. Or, said another way, if you draw a perfectly diagonal line on the graph, then the inverse graph will be the exact same as the original graph, but mirrored about this line. You can see an example [Here](_URL_0_). So how does this apply for the graph of arcsin? The big issue is that sin(x) actually does not have an inverse function. It does not pass the [Horizontal Line Test](_URL_2_). For a graph to be a function, it must pass the Vertical Line Test, which says that every vertical line hits the graph at most once. For your function to have an inverse, then it's mirror image about the diagonal must also be a function, which means the mirror image must pass the Vertical Line Test, but because the mirror image of a vertical line about the diagonal is a horizontal line, a function will have an inverse exactly when every horizontal line hits it's graph at most once. Sine does not pass the horizontal line test. How can we fix this? Maybe we can cut sine up into a much smaller graph where it *does* pass the Horizontal Line Test. It doesn't make sense to start at x=0, because that's kinda in the middle, we want to start at one of the maximums or minimums of the graph. So if we start at x=-pi/2, where sin(x)=-1, and trace it to x=pi/2, where sin(x)=1, then we will have hit every point that sine can take, and if we enlarge this at all, then we'll repeat numbers and fail the Horizontal Line Test. [This is what this restricted graph of sine looks like. ](_URL_1_) It clearly passes the Horizontal Line Test and has an inverse, and you'll notice that if we mirror that graph about the diagonal, you get [exactly the graph of arcsin(x)](_URL_3_).
 Barring any external forces or possible effects from gravitational waves, you stay in the ellipse.
 Okay. You would not suffer skin friction drag, but you would still be subject to pressure drag. Which might lead you to think you would be faster. But you because you can't cause any friction on the water you can't propel yourself nearly as well. Most of the force generated when you swim isn't actually from the water you push on directly. It's from the water that it sucks along with it. This is known as the venturi effect. If you cant drag water and cause this vorticity you can't propel yourself. If you had a different source of propulsion like a propeller then yes you would be faster. As far as buoyancy is concerned. It would be marginally different. The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the water your body displaces.You are still (almost) the same size so there is no effect on buoyancy.
 13 Billion is the [age of the universe](_URL_2_). A very compelling piece of evidence is the [cosmic microwave background](_URL_1_). The [inevitable Heat Death of the Universe](_URL_3_) is on a much [much longer timescale](_URL_0_).
 The behavior you are describing makes sense when you take into account the [Law of Large Numbers](_URL_0_). Basically, just because something *can* happen, doesn't mean that it will, because as you add more samples the system behaves more like we would *expect* the system to behave. In the case of particles, you have billions and billions of particles and the chance that a significant portion of them happen to behave contrary to what you would expect is vanishingly small.
 It takes the entire mass of the earth (a big thing!) to drag a scrap of paper or some drops of water downwards to the floor. Yet I can run a comb through my hair a couple times to build up a little static charge, and then get the scrap of paper to jump off the ground and stick to my comb, or get a thin stream of water falling down out of the tap to jump towards the comb. That's how I get a personal 'sense' of the differences of strengths of the EM versus gravitational forces. (Admittedly the R in 1/R^2 plays a big role here too.) I'm sure some other answers will provide quantitative responses, but I like looking at the real-life experiences which suggest the difference.
 There appears to be some confusion with the terminology. *Exoplanet* stands for extrasolar (i.e. out of the Solar System) planets - I'll let astronomers answer about those but as far as I know, we have no idea about their magnetic fields. EM stands for *electromagnetic*, and Juno doesn't need protection against it. Jupiter doesn't emit any harmful electromagnetic radiation (by harmful I mean ionizing, i.e. UV, X rays or gamma rays). The magnetic field was discovered in the '1950s by observing the radio emissions, and some initial estimates were made. But it was only in the '1970s when the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft made the first measurements that some accuracy was achieved. They had [several scientific instruments](_URL_0_) to measure the magnetic field and radiation environment through different methods. What Juno needs to be protected from is electron radiation, which in Jupiter's immediate surroundings is very strong. Pioneer 11 was risking to be fried by this radiation as it hadn't been appropriately designed for it (it was underestimated since engineer's didn't have any concrete data). Electronics are mostly sensitive to radiation, and since Jovian electrons can reach up to 100 MeV they can penetrate like 10 cm in Aluminium, so the most sensitive devices must be placed deep inside the probe, protected by the walls or other less sensitive equipment. Solar panels are also sensitive and they cannot be easily protected, so they will inevitably have degraded significantly by the end of the planned mission time.
 This is a bit of an odd question. The evidence for the fossil record *is* the fossil record. Radiometric dating gives us the ages of rocks, and the fossils we find in those rocks show evolutionary patterns. The amount of data out there is staggering. To the point I'm really not sure where to even start giving you links. There's a century and a half of peer reviewed science on the matter. Perhaps the neater answer to the flood vs evolution argument can be given by looking at the rocks themselves. The total sedimentary record is literally hundreds of kilometers thick. Some of that is currently in-situ within active sedimentary basins. The vast majority of it is now tilted, folded, and generally modified by plate tectonics. For the flood argument to have any kind of claim in reality, a mechanism would have to be proposed that explained (as a few examples off the top of my head):1. How the lifeforms int eh earliest sediments change gradually and continuously into more complex and advanced forms2. How you drop the volume of sediment in a timely manner. Given that sedimentation rates for most sediments are in the order of  < mm per year. 3. [How you deposit the earliest rocks, deform them, metamorphose them, erode part of them away, and then continue depositing more material on top of them in anything less than tens of millions of years](_URL_1_). 4. How igneous activity can be injected into one rock, cause metamorphism in some rocks, but leaving adjacent rocks unaffected? Cooling times are often in the orders of tens of millenia. In fact, the very earliest attempts at calculating the age of the Earth based on sedimentation rates are informative (from [here](_URL_0_)): > In 1860, the thickness of total sedimentary record is divided by average sedimentation rates (in mm/yr) and calculated to be about 3 million years old. In 1910, the same measurement yields about 1.6 billion years old. > Early measurements of maximum thickness of sediment ranged from 25,000 m to 112,000 m. With more recent mapping, thickness of fossiliferous rocks is at least 150,000 m. The average sedimentation rates are about 0.3 m/1000 years. At this rate, the age of the first fossiliferous rocks is about 500 million years. This calculation does not account for past erosion or differences in sedimentation rates; also ancient sedimentary rocks are metamorphosed or melted. Therefore will hugely underestimate the final result. For the record, it's also worth pointing out that the 'I only believe it if I've done the experiment myself' is really bad science. If that were the basis of everything we do, then we'd still be re-inventing the wheel. By all means *challenge* the work of others, but don't just dismiss it. Rather than ignoring science unless he can do the experiment himself, suggest that he looks at challenging the findings of individual works he does not believe. Papers (should) present their results in a way that means  the work can be repeated and challenged. There is a tendency for some to use this 'I only believe work I've done myself' as implying 'controversy' in the science. It's really nothing more than denialism.
 Yes and no, depending on how old. As we grow from a child to an adult our bones are not all fused together. The sutures in the skull continue to close during life. In old people the sutures often ossify to the point where they are completely bone, and different [sutures close at different times](_URL_2_), although suture closure in of itself is not necessarily reliable. There are other bones with epiphyses that fuse and can correlate with age, such as the [clavicle](_URL_1_), [vertebrae](_URL_0_), and long bones such as the femur. However, these methods are useful for years ranging into young adulthood, but not necessarily afterward. Most epiphyseal fusions have occurred by age 25, but it is still possible to use other bones such as the skull for a rough estimate of later years, although the margin of error can be high depending on what other information is available. The range of things that can affect parts of the body such as skin make using skin an extremely unreliable source of age determination, whereas changes to bone tend to be more uniform and chronological. I wouldn't suggest removing someone's femur to determine their age though, that might get you in some trouble. ;)
 These are not the same questions, and I'm not sure I understand what you're asking in the second question. So, I'll answer the first question:Yes. The force that is holding an expandable, sealed container in the "crushed" state, in our everyday experience, is air pressure. We live at the bottom of an ocean of air, with approximately 1 atmosphere of pressure squishing everything from all sides. When you squish an expandable container and then seal it, the materials of the container will be exerting some small force attempting to re-expand into their neutral configuration, In order to do so, however, they would end up expanding the volume inside the container while keeping the number of gas molecules the same. Air pressure is just the average force exerted against some surface by bouncing gas molecules. For a constant temperature, the greater the density of molecules, the more molecules bounce per unit time, and thus the greater the force exerted. There are enough molecules outside the container to exert that 1 atmosphere of pressure. If the container were to expand, there would be a much lower density of gas molecules inside than out. That results in a net force that pushes the container back into the "squished" state until the force of the gas molecules inside + the force exerted by the material of the container is equal to the 1 atmosphere of pressure from the outside. In an vacuum, that 1 atmosphere of pressure is reduced to zero (or approximately zero in the imperfect vacuum of space). There is no outside force to counter the force of the container materials as they try to revert to their equilibrium configuration. They would thus revert to that configuration. Naturally, if you sealed the container in the atmosphere and then put it into a vacuum, the container would end up expanding even more, like a balloon, because the left-over gas inside the container would exert a net force outward against the zero pressure outside.
 It's not our bodies that become immune, it's the bacteria that become 'immune' except that 'immune' isn't the right word here. what you mean is that the bacteria become resistant. Antibiotics kill bacteria (incidentally, you should know that they don't have any effect on viruses so don't take them for the common cold or something). However, by random chance, there is a bacterium in your bacteria population that has a mutation that endows it with resistance to that particular antibiotic. This bacterium has always had this mutation and you adding antibiotic hasn't changed anything in that respect. However, this mutation has never been advantageous, until now, so there has only been a  very low proportion of bacteria with the gene of resistance. What happens is that if you stop taking the antibiotic for a day or two or something, you increase the chance that not all of the bacteria were killed and give time for them to recover, so you are singling out the few resistant ones by killing all the non-resistant ones. With only the few resistant bacteria remaining, they have no competition from others so they multiply rapidly until there are only resistant bacteria and your antibiotic is now useless. moral of the story: listen to the doctor.
 It depends on the volume you can keep them in. If the collision probability is low it is equivalent to keeping positive ions. The LHC accelerates bunches of about 100 billion protons, and that is by far not the record for accelerators (it is the number I know without looking it up). You have two mechanics to lose the ions: In a collision you might get neutral atoms that escape afterwards. And keeping too many ions close together leads to electrostatic repulsion, which means your ions get enough energy to escape if you put in too many.
 We don't have to know exactly where the collision happens (it just has to be inside the detector which is extremely large in comparison with where the uncertainly principle would limit us)
 Foam is an example of a [complex fluid](_URL_0_), in this case having properties in between that of a liquid and a gas.
 Hydrochloride salts of drugs are often easier to work with. The native form of the drug is often an oily liquid at room temperature, while the hydrochloride salt is a powder which can be shaped into a pill for easy administration. Once the drug is in your stomach, it dissolves into HCL + the drug. Conveniently, there’s already a lot of hydrochloric acid in your stomach, so adding a little bit more is basically harmless, and the drug can go on to the intestines to be absorbed into your bloodstream.
 Because of symmetry breaking. Phase transition is not a process, but a state for few molecules. Molecules attract each other pretty much like weak fridge magnets. Let's pretend the molecules are like these weak magnets, in a glass box being shaken vigorously. They attract each other, but as soon as they can bind themselves to one another they hit the wall or another molecule, splitting them apart again. That's the liquid state. If you, however, shake the glass box less and less(decreasing energy, thus temperature) the molecules will stop hitting themselves so hard, and eventuallyl giving the chance for the molecules to start binding themselves together and stay that way, giving form to the solid state. That's why you see water crystals in freezing water, it's nothing more than conglomerates of molecules that were given the chance to bind together and stay that way. The point that they start binding together is given the name "freezing point, 42F. ^^ Hope it helps
 > I understand that a winglet adds drag, simply because it exists. This is wrong, and is a drastic oversimplification of aerodynamics. You can take a given shape, add material to it, and end up with less drag. An easy example is a spoiler. A geometrically easy example is to take a cylinder and add a flat plate trailing behind it, parallel to the flow. It'll have less total drag than the plain cylinder. There are a couple physical explanations for why winglets reduce drag; I tend to think of the various explanations as being a kind of chicken-or-the-egg problem, because saying one effect causes another as opposed to the latter causing the former can be a little tricky. [A lifting wing creates tip vortices. ](_URL_1_) The basic forces acting on a wing are that the lower side has a higher pressure than the upper side, so you get a net upward force. Now, "nature abhors a vacuum" so fluids want to move from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure, but over most of the wing there's a physical... wing in the way so they can't. But as you get towards the tip, high pressure air under the wing can sort of *go around* the tip, creating the vorticity mentioned in that article. The simplest way to think of how winglets work is that they partially block that flow. Those tip vortices do two things: first, the loss of lift associated with that means you have to pitch up a little more to achieve the same lift, and that in itself increases drag. But important to this discussion, it also creates [induced drag](_URL_0_) because that vorticity diverts flow to create an effective drag. Note the equation there for induced drag (CDi) where the term "AR" is in the denominator, that's "Aspect Ratio", essentially a ratio of the length of the wing over the area. *You can think of winglets as simply increasing the effective aspect ratio. * If you were to flatten that out, you'd simply have a longer wing, and that reduces the induced drag. There's another explanation (and it depends on the precise configuration) where deflection of the airflow effectively makes the winglet act like a sail on a ship, which actually creates forward thrust.
 Can you be a little more specific with what you mean by "tolerance"? For example, your body could be come "tolerant" to illicit drugs, requiring higher doses to achieve the same affect. Or your body could become "tolerant" to some antibiotic, requiring more or different drugs to treat an infection. Both might be considered examples of "tolerance", but they work by very different mechanisms.
 I think a major issue would be DNA replication. [Telomeres](_URL_0_) aren't regenerated when DNA is reproduced, I am probably going to butcher the description but when DNA is replicated the DNA polymerase can't start a strand from scratch so it starts just before the end (at least in one direction, I'm not even gonna attempt to explain okazaki fragments) . The end is made of repeated strings of basically junk DNA to give it extra room to work with, but this results in a limited number of replications. [The Hayflick Limit](_URL_1_) is the point at which cells can no longer effectively replicate the DNA. Research is being done on activating telomerase to lengthen telomeres but I don't know how far along it is. Hope I didn't butcher that too much.
 I just want to give your question an answer since you aren't getting one. The answer is nobody knows. Angler fish are deep sea fish so even seeing them is rare, studying their antibodies in action would be near impossible. I will say this, however. Many organisms have developed mechanisms to deter rejections from a host body. Most parasitic species have to do this. I imagine the male angler does something similar, but I'm just speculating.
 Cape flapping is a result of fluid-structure interaction. Without fluid (atmosphere), that goes away, because there's no energy source to sustain the flapping in the face of (usually insignificant, but non-negligible at long time-scales in vacuum) dissipation of kinetic energy in the cloth. There could still be some flapping if it was excited mechanically, e.g. if Superman "flew" in some non-steady way that excited a vibrational mode in the cape.
 Ullage motors! Ether small solid fuel rockets on the outside of the upper stage, or the reaction control system is used in much the same way, and all the fuel sloshes to the bottom of the tank and gets pumped to the engine.
 That derivation of the Casimir effect is simplified with the assumption that the fine structure constant is infinite, which allows it to be derived much more easily. A full derivation considers the relativistic van der Waals attraction between two real plates, which is more complicated and less handwavy: _URL_0_
 Ok, I'll try answer this to the best of my knowledge. DNA - at face value looks more like a random assortment of G, C A and T. But in actual fact, there are particular patterns (sequences), which form these things called "open reading frames" (ORFs). In these open reading frames, we have particular sequences called elements which are recognised by special binding proteins. These binding proteins are the result of various downstream signalling sequences which have been influenced by various stimuli (physiological, chemical, hormonal primordially). These binding proteins then influence gene expression (genes, by the way are particular sequences in the ORF which contain the sequence which when translated - via mRNA - forms a peptide which alters cellular function) and therefore affect the way a cell functions. As for these "valid strings" - I'm not particularly familiar with that lingo, but being primarily into biochemistry, I'll assume that you refer to regions of DNA which through genomic mapping have particular predisposition to a disease, trait or just overall phenotype. To be honest, from my perspective, not everything is known about the human genome (though we have mapped it) and these particular "strings" found along the genome are the major centres or points of regulation. And actually, current knowledge is that most of the human genome is used (transcribed), though not all of it is translated. There's a very new subject in genetics and biochemistry, all about something called ncRNA, and could very well have answers to some of life's more interesting conundrums (but don't get your hopes up). And in terms of expressive validity - first you need to transcribe it - and that's where elements come in. Remember me mentioning ORFs - at the start of an ORF are particular sequences - in eukaryotes, there is something called a TATA box - this is a useful marker of the start of an ORF - or at least 20 base pairs upstream of one. Of course, there are other features which are important as well - such as the initiator sequence or motive ten element - but of course, there are many others - and each element may as well be specific to a particular gene. Now to answer those further questions:**where does this grammar come from? ** - I have no idea. There must have been some sort of evolutionary event that led to this. But my knowledge only extends as far as the ideas of abiogenesis - from lipid membrane formation and spontaneous DNA formation, and also the endosymbiont theory (mitochondrial relevance). **Where is it located? ** DNA is located in the nucleus. As far as I know, regulation of gene expression (and overall cellular function really), however can occur at any stage of transcription (DNA to RNA), translation (RNA to protein) or even at the final stages of protein maturation - or even after it has been fully synthesised. **Does it evolve? ** Continuously. Just as mutations in the DNA sequence can occur at any time and at any (usually slow - depends on the exposure to mutagens) rate. These binding proteins - that I mentioned earlier sometimes can bind to different elements - either to up or down regulate genetic expression. Mutations may affect their binding, or the expression of the protein itself. Sometimes, it may create a completely different functional protein (from the gene). **How does it work? ** TLDR of my initial paragraph - DNA has a particular pattern - specific ones called elements - binding proteins bind to them and affect gene expression. Resources: [*Voet, Voet and Pratt* - **Fundamentals of Biochemistry**](_URL_1_) - It's a textbook (my favourite biochem textbook :3), I'll try find some online sources. About [abiogenesis](_URL_2_) - Start about 3 minutes in - that's when the real juice is. Take my knowledge with a pinch of salt. The world is constantly learning and evolving. We as scientists are just doing our best to keep up with it. Also, I don't even have a degree yet. **Edit:** Some online resources which I think might help you understand molecular biology in a simpler way. [Transcription](_URL_0_)[Translation](_URL_3_)Or try out this user friendly [website](_URL_4_) by the University of Utah! Keep in mind, that these are the basics - for us to understand the greater function of this, take into account that for a different function, there will be a different structure, and different genetic basis. Though overall interconnected, everything has a way of staying segregated.
 The two biggest things that come to mind are yield (how much trees vs how much kg of apple the trees produce), which as to be quite constant from one year to another (the trees in our home don't produce a lot of apple every year and it doesn't seem to be tightly linked to the dryness of the year), and the fact that the link probably accounts for water used in rinsing and processing the apples (otherwise that number for chocolate would be weird imo).
 Instead of just talking about quantum dots, we can make the question a bit more broader. We could ask, can confining the dimensionality of a material make it a better superconductor than in the bulk? Then we would have a few types of systems to play around with (summarized in [this graph](_URL_4_)):1. 2D quantum wells (QW) [Btw, these are the structures we call 2D, not the dots, so I'll focus on these]2. 1D nanowires (NW)3. 0D quantum dots (QD)With those preliminaries out of the way, we can look at some actual evidence. So far studies of confined superconductors are a bit sparse, but some effects have already been observed. For example, in [this paper](_URL_0_), researchers saw oscillations in the critical temperature of a QW superconductor based on its thickness [as shown in this diagram](_URL_3_). As you can see the change is rather subtle and mostly goes the wrong way. In [follow up work](_URL_2_) other reseachers only saw a big change when going to the ultimate 2D limit (just one or two layers) [as shown here](_URL_1_). Unfortunately again, the critical temperature just dropped. Now it's not all bad news. Even when the effect on the critical temperature is not huge, playing around with the dimensionality is still useful. For example, you can use nanowires to make really nice [single photon detectors](_URL_5_). These use multiple semiconducting strips to create discrete channels for photon detection (see [image](_URL_6_)), which often come very handy. Moreover, we have only begun to graze the surface of this field. It is possible that by playing around with other nano-structures and their surrounding medium, we will be able to make a much larger impact on the critical temperature and other properties. It's certainly a topic worth investigating more...
 The good news is that alcohol resistance is way harder than, say, penicillin resistance. Penicillin binds a certain protein in order to disrupt bacterial cell walls. If you change that one protein, you're resistant. This is an easy enough adaptation that a lot of bacteria have been resistant for many years. (Still works great on syphilis, though.) Alcohol, on the other hand, changes the configuration of all kinds of proteins and dissolves cell membranes. It's a much more aggressive and non-specific attack; if antibiotics are poison, alcohol is like a flamethrower. The only bacteria that can resist it are the ones that have always known how to form spores for defense, like those in the genus Clostridium (causes of tetanus and C diff diarrhea) or the genus Bacillus (anthrax, botulism.) Because spore-forming is such a huge and fundamental change, it's much less likely to happen in other species of bacteria. Topical antibiotics aren't as worrying as oral or injected drugs because they don't touch nearly as many bacteria, but resistant bacteria have indeed been observed in topical treatment of acne.
 Because of evolution. If spoiled food tasted good, we would eat more spoiled food, and we would die. The reason the taste changes can be several things, depending on a lot of factors. Some compounds in the food react with the air around it with time (like fats in butter going sour due to reacting with oxygen). Other instances are due to bacteria or fungi infecting the food, and these organisms can have a taste themselves (again, evolution caused us to taste these, since those who can taste the "badness" are less likely to die from poisoning, and thus are more likely to produce offspring), or the organisms create other compounds when digesting the food that we have developed the ability to taste.
 This is a lake shore property. The ice is coming off the lake, moved by the wind. Imagine a *huge* sheet of ice, several square kilometers, and blow a strong, steady wind across it. The force from all the wind adds up and can be enough to push the entire ice sheet slowly, but steadily onto land. This results in what you see in the video here.
 The stability of both chemical molecules and atoms themselves often depends on what is energetically favourable. If a molecule is the lowest energy configuration of a certain element under certain conditions, then it won't suddenly turn into a different configuration without an energy input. Which precise configuration is the most energetically stable depends on a lot of factors, including temperature and pressure. A good example is carbon, which has a large number of different configurations. At standard temperature and pressure, graphite is the most stable configuration, but other configurations ( such as diamond ) can be quite stable as well, even if they ( very slowly ) turn into graphite. At higher pressures ( REALLY high ) diamond is more stable. Which configuration is more energetically stable is a rather complicated matter which often depends on quantum mechanical properties of particular molecules and atoms. For many compounds it is true that atoms try to "fill their shells", but it is not a perfect rule. For larger atoms and molecules the quantum mechanics can get fairly complicated and it is not always feasible to predict what will actually happen from theory alone. To take an even more counter-intuitive example, the noble gases are usually very inert, and don't form molecules. However, under very specific conditions it is possible to form molecules involving Xenon and Fluorine. Under even more crazy conditions ( such as bombarding a helium plasma with hydrogen ions ) it's even possible to make molecules containing Helium, the arguably least reactive atom there is. Furthermore, even if a particular configuration is not the most energetically favourable it may still be sufficiently stable to remain in its configuration for extended periods of time. Diamond is again a good example. Under normal conditions it is technically less stable than graphite, but because the C-C bond is so strong, and because the crystal structure of diamond is very stable, teh rate at which diamond turns into graphite is so fantastically slow that it can be neglected for practical purposes.
 Yes. There's a nice writeup on xkcd's What-If section about a [relativistic baseball](_URL_0_).
 It was casually suggested by John Wheeler in 1940. You shouldn't think of it as a serious idea. The idea is that there's one single electron moving back and forth in time. The positron is when the electron is moving backwards in time. In fact, a positron does look like an electron in the opposite direction of time. However, it also makes the prediction that there's an equal number of electrons and positrons, which appears to be incorrect.
 It's a very good question. First of all, it's not at all sure inflation happened, but it seems by far the most plausible theory. Second, if even if it happened, we don't know yet which model describes it accurately. This includes when and how it stopped. I recently learned that Andrei Linde's early contribution was that his simple model not only showed how inflation could happen but also how it could end. Third: similarly there are many ideas about inflation, one of which is called "eternal inflation". This one says that different patches of the universe are 'inflating' independently, and some of those patches are still inflating. This lies completely outside our observable part of the universe, so one could say it has no consequence at all. For our part of the universe, we don't observe anything like inflation going on at the moment, so any model should include having it stopped at some point. You may be interested in [Matt Strassler's very informative weblog](_URL_1_) and in particular [his page on inflation](_URL_0_).
 I think you might be misunderstanding the whole wave-partical duality thing, at least with regard to a measurement collapsing the wave function for one particle, and erasing the whole interference pattern in the double slit experiment by introducing deterministic information into the apparatus about which slit a particle goes through. The state of one detected particle, and the state of the whole apparatus, and all the particles flying through it, are not one in the same. The whole diffraction pattern is the state of all the particles overlapped in a sort of ambiguous smear. If you put a detector on the screen where the interference pattern is showing, it will detect individual particles, but that does not destroy the interference pattern. The interference pattern is caused by the ambiguity of which slit a particle went through, which you cannot determine by detecting the particle on the screeen. It could have gone through either. The path ambiguity remains, and so does the interference pattern. The diffraction pattern is a statistical manifestation of possibility created by the ambiguity. To erase the interference pattern, you need to impart information into the system about which slit the light goes through. This is most easily done by carefully putting two polarizing filters in front of the two separate slits. Photons have a polarity, and polarizing filters block light in a special way depending on its orientation, polarizing it in the direction of the filter. If one filter is rotated 90 degrees to the other, the light from each slit is polarized at right angles. This means it contains information about which slit it went through. This removes the ambiguity of which slit a photon goes through that is so necessary to maintaining the overlapping possibility that produces the diffraction pattern. Without the filters, the wave interference pattern shows. With the filters in at right angles, the two banded pattern of particles shows. But this does not change what the detector on the screen notices, it always detected particles the same way, with or without the diffraction pattern. There is not a connection between detecting a particle on the screen and extracting deterministic information about the particle path.
 The "rain that consists of diamonds" has not been observed, that's just a guess based on what might happen if a planet contained mostly hydrocarbons. The "breathable air" and "poisonous gas" scenarios are rooted more in actual observations. In very rare cases, a planet passes in front of its star and we can observe the changes in light absorbtion spectra as a result. With this data you can perform spectroscopy and get a rough idea of what compounds might be present in a planet's atmosphere. _URL_1__URL_0_
 It is only *causal* influences that are limites to the speed of light. You cannot use entangled particles to transmit useful information (without communicating via other means, first). Imagine Alice and Bob are light years away and each have a set of entangled particles - say the spins of the particles are correlated. When they measure them, no matter who measures first, each observer on either end will always see a set of random spins. It cant be used to transmit any *useful information* (unless Alice and Bob first make an intergalactic phone call and discuss their spin basis, but this would travel at lightspeed). Anything that can transmit useful information (which could change the course of events) is limited to *c*.
 Neither. I haven't done any work to see if the water you exhale is a bigger effect, but here is my stab at it. Inhale as much as you can. This will make no difference, but then compress your chest as much as you can without exhaling. This will hurt, but the compression will increase the density of the air- that is, you will become smaller, while not becoming less massive. This will reduce your buoyancy. EDIT: It looks like 900 breaths / hour is normal (at rest). Say we exhale 65 ml of water per hour (_URL_1_), that's .0722 lm per breath, which weight 72.2 milligrams. Wikipedia has trumpet players blowing about 1.9 psi (_URL_2_)That's would bring lung volume down to .8867 * original volume. A person can exhale around a litre of air (_URL_0_)which weighs 1.27 grams, so the difference in displaced air mass outside the body during the compression would weigh 1.27*.8867 = 1.12 grams, which is much more than the 72.2 milligrams of water. So your best option is by far to inhale a lot of air (to get the mass), then compress it inside yourself (to reduce your volume).
 There's no reason that such a long half-life isn't possible. It could just take a very, very, very long time for Sm-149 to decay. I think the point you may be getting at is how such a half-life could be *measured* (so that we could make such a claim). First of all, a fact: if you get enough radioactive stuff, we have a formula to predict how many decays you should see over time, on average. This formula (exponential decay) depends on the half-life of the material and how much of it you have at the start. Now let's imagine an experiment. We have a big pile of Sm-149, and we're going to watch it for a year. Now, if we know a half-life, then our formula tells us how many nuclei should decay in a year given the size of the pile. But we watch our pile for a year, and find that we see no decays. This means that our formula should tell us, if we blindly plug in numbers, that our pile should have on average *less than one nucleus decay in a year* (I'm not quite being accurate about some statistics here). This tells us a *minimum* half-life; if the half-life were shorter, we would have seen a nucleus decay. So the claim is just that we watched enough Sm-149 for long enough and didn't see any decays, so the half-life must be exceptionally long if it decays at all.
 The accuracy of a clock doesn't have anything to do with the one that has the correct time of day. You can easily have an atomic clock that's set to the wrong time of day. What makes an atomic clock "accurate" is the fact that its rate of progression is more uniform than another kind of clock. The best way to test this? Get a bunch of them, set them all to the same time, and watch how quickly they fall out of sync. You can actually try this. See if you can find a cheap mechanical clock. Buy a few of them and set them all to the same time. They will fall out of sync, and sooner than you think. Don't try it with quartz clocks; they're shockingly accurate (even the cheap ones), and it could take years for you to be able to measure a difference.
 You can construct geocentric models that take into account any simple observation you might make; people did so for a long time. The way to go would be to show that heliocentric models provide simpler explanations. The usually-cited problematic observation is the apparent retrograde motion of the planets. If you watch how the planets move relative to the stars, sometimes they reverse their direction for a while. In a heliocentric model, this occurs because the earth is moving past that planet, while in a geocentric model, you generally need to assume that the planets are moving along a more complicated path.
 Yes, this is called a “superinfection.”The effects will vary quite a bit depending on the details. Many of the responses of the immune system to an infection are general – if you get infected with two rhinoviruses (one of the virus types that causes “colds”) of the same type or two rhinoviruses of different types, the cells around the area of infection will respond in essentially the same way – principally by activating inflammation and something called the “antiviral state.”The response of your adaptive immune system (T-cells and B-cells) will be a bit different, since there would be two sets of activating signals with a co-infection, but it’s hard to max out an immune response, and to some extent the different viruses will be competing with each other. It’s possible that it will take you longer to recover, but I’m not aware of any solid data on this. On the other hand, if you are co-infected with two different types of infection, say a bacterial and a viral infection, this can cause serious problems, since the immune response necessary to deal with viruses and the response necessary to deal with bacteria can be quite different, and the response to one can be counterproductive to the response to the other. In fact, most people that die “of the flu” actually die from bacterial infections of the lung that were able to gain a foothold because of the immune response to the flu virus.
 Mine Ventilation Student- Personally, I would say bring the cold air in, it cools you down faster and more directly. If you were to implement an exhausting system it would be best to open another window to ensure steady state air movement.
 The fact they look similar doesn't matter. There is something called convergent evolution; two different species come up with the same solution. Think of wings on bats and birds. Bats are closer to horses than birds, since they are both mammals, even though they look closer to a bird. There was a better example about an extinct amphibious reptile being very similar to modern dolphins, even though on an evolutionary level they are very different.

 It's not 100% correct to say that "corn isn't digested". The part that humans cannot digest is the outer kernal, which is made of cellulose. The portion of the corn within the kernals has lots of goodies:A cup of cooked fresh, frozen or canned corn provides you with 4 to 5 g of protein; 1 to 2 g of fat; 5 to 7 g of sugar; and 25 to 26 g of starch.
 The quick answer is the rate of rainfall. However, drizzle isn't a rate of rainfall,  it is a precipitation particle size. That is, drizzle is smaller than a raindrop ( < 0.02" in diameter), and can fall at varying rates, in general, much lighter rates than raindrops. For **drizzle**, these categories are1) Light: Trace-.01"/hr2)Moderate: .01"-.02"/hr3)Heavy: .02"-.04"/hrWhen the precipitation rate is more than .04"/hr for liquid, the precipitation type is in general, rain. The rates at which **raindrops** fall into three categories as well:1)Light: Trace-0.10"/hr2)Moderate: 0.11"/hr-0.30"/hr3)Heavy:  > 0.30"/hrYou can look [here](_URL_1_) and [here](_URL_0_) for more information on rain vs. drizzle vs. mist vs. fog. **Edit**: Also, the drop sizes and precipitation rates are mostly done by [ASOS](_URL_2_) stations automatically with some fairly sophisticated instrumentation, but can also be done with more primitive equipment.
 The question requires more speculation than science to answer, but I think it can reveal some important principles. First off, the evolution of organisms are completely dependent on the environment their confronted with. For that reason, we could expect some exotic and unfamiliar biology if it exists on Mars. Though it's impossible to say what morphology (shape, form, color) we'd find, we can make some decent inferences from what we know of the Martian environment. At a cellular level, organisms will have something like DNA (a stable, replicable molecule capable of coding information), though perhaps not DNA itself. The thinner atmosphere will select for a strong mechanisms for repairing damage to their 'information' molecule by way of UV light and other inflictions from the sun, [not unlike existing pathways on earth](_URL_2_). However, it's possible that organisms could somehow take advantage of the increased energy passing through the atmosphere with some form of photosynthesis, though perhaps not like the one we know on earth. Because oxygen is low on mars, most organisms would be [anaerobic](_URL_1_), though [animals](_URL_0_) are known to bypass this under certain conditions. At a tissue level, I'd imagine many animals would have some innovation for retaining water, which is as far as we know, also scarce on mars. This could come in the form of a thick cuticle or some sort of waxy covering. At a morphological level, I have no real idea. The reduced gravity could lead to denser tissue, but that produces it's own host of problems (waste and heat regulation, diffusion of nutrients, etc). If I had to guess, I'd say we'd see something more like filamentous fungus that spread out in thin but extensive networks over the soil of Mars. You could get pretty complex and interesting behavior out of this, but not like we're familiar with on earth. I cite that to illustrate a key point- the diversity of form and strategy on Earth in incredible, and it's very possible a thriving ecosystem on another planet would look anything like how we imagine the same on Earth. The same could be said for any intelligent being. The network struture of a martian fungus type thing could form something that like neural connections, just spread out over miles and miles. Moreover, we know the conditions on earth pretty well, but I think it's hard from that to infer that dinosaurs would have dominated the Earth, or that mammals would dominate the megafauna millions of years later. This is because life evolves in response to the largely stochastic forces of nature, and there's an incredible array of solutions to the problems these forces suggest.
 I don’t know the exact scientific response but in regards to rain and tires used on Consumer grade vehicles the worst and most dangerous time for traction is right when it starts to rain. The initial moisture mixes with the dirt/oil/other contaminates on the road surface until it rinses most of it away.
 They didn't need to worry about anything other than food and shelter (as if that wasn't enough)? How about if they can mate with that attractive woman? Or if they will be eaten by whatever is making those noises at night? Or what the hell kind of monster is making lightning and thunder? Does the moon want him dead? Is that scratch on his foot going to fester, rotting off his leg and killing him from blood poisoning? Will he lose contests with rival men, and if so can he survive? It astonishes me that people today think that the angst they feel about their cell phone payment is something entirely new to the human experience.
 There's a good physics model in this paper:Physical aspects of the greenhouse effect and global warmingAmerican Journal of Physics 67, 1227 (1999); _URL_0_The basics are that radiation comes in at one blackbody temp (the sun's) which can mostly pass through the atmosphere and heat up the ground. The ground rises up to some temperature and radiates heat at a different blackbody temperature. Some part of this ground radiation gets absorbed by the atmosphere, which then is at a third blackbody temperature. This atmosphere blackbody radiates (in all directions), sending some radiation back to the earth, heating it up even more. You can work out the equilibrium temperature in this simple case, if you put in various numbers. Just a cautionary note, the earth is a very complex system and a simple model like above doesn't capture this complexity. For instance, cloud cover has a significant effect on global temperatures, because clouds reflect sunlight back into space. So if increasing atmospheric CO2 increases or decreases cloud formation, you have to take that into account. People offer the simple physics of greenhouse effect, which was known 100 years ago, as proof of the earth warming, since the rise in atmospheric CO2 is well established. But the simple physics argument is not good proof, the earth's is too complex. The best evidence for the effect of CO2 on global temperatures is from complex computer models of the earth-ocean-atmosphere, known as GCMs  (General circulation model or global climate model). Depending on their complexity, GCMs can take into account the rotating earth, the sun, the ocean the different layers of the atmosphere, cloud formation, etc. When you take a good GCM and increase the CO2 levels in the atmosphere (they call it forcing), you can see usually see an increase in global temperatures. Climate scientists argue about the exact level of increase, because different GCMs give different values.
 Putting environmental factors aside, there are two main processes that regulate sleep/wake cycles. **1. The circadian rhythm. ** There is group of pacemaker cells in the hypothalamus called the [suprachiasmatic nucleus](_URL_0_). These neurons produce a circadian (~24-h) rhythm in sleepiness, promoting sleep during the biological night and promoting wake during the biological day. **2. The sleep homeostatic process. ** During wake, sleep pressure increases, and during sleep it is dissipated. The reason for this is not fully understood, but it involves the accumulation of sleep-regulatory substances in the brain during wake (including adenosine, nitric oxide, interleukin-1, TNF-alpha, and prostaglandin D2) as well as depletion of neuronal ATP stores. When people sleep at a normal time, these two processes cooperate to induce sleep onset at night and arousal in the morning. At night, sleep homeostatic pressure is high from being awake all day, and the circadian drive for wakefulness is beginning to rapidly dip, allowing sleep onset. A couple of hours before this, sleep onset is extremely difficult due to the very strong circadian drive for wakefulness and this is sometimes referred to as the 'wake maintenance zone'. This is one of the main reasons it is difficult to shift back to an earlier schedule after staying up late on any of the previous nights, as the wake maintenance zone has now shifted later. In the morning, sleep pressure is now low from sleeping, and the circadian drive for wakefulness is now beginning to rise (after hitting a minimum around a couple of hours before normal wake-time), allowing wake onset to occur.
 It disperses. I like to compare (for simplicity) electric effects to water and rivers and lakes. Picture grounding electricity as rain landing in the ocean. It found an area of lower potential and now it is at a universal potential distribution where it doesn't have anywhere to go or any reason to go there. Electricity is just moving electrons. Once they get to the earth, the reason that the electrons moved in the first place has a negligible effect on the earth as a whole, so it reaches equilibrium. The reasons for the magnetic poles is drastically more complicated.
 In short, because the weak interaction does not conserve strangeness, but the strong force does. The strangeness of a ~~hardon~~ hadron is just the sum of its constituent strange quarks minus the anti-strange quarks. The strong interaction can't change one quark into another, all it can do is create or destroy strange/anti-strange pairs. The weak force, on the other hand, can change one type of quark into another via a W boson. The concept of strangeness was invented to explain why some particles created in cloud chambers were so long-lived. If they decayed via a strong interaction you would expect them to live only a short time, similar to the lifetime of other particles that decay via the strong force. Since the weak force is weaker, it takes longer for particles to decay weakly. Thus, if there was some conservation law that the strong force obeyed but the weak force didn't, it would explain why these weird particles lived longer than expected (since they wouldn't be able to decay strongly without violating the conservation law). None of the details of quarks or the weak force were understood at the time that this concept was invented, so it was created as a heuristic way to explain what might be happening.
 Devices like that, which could in principle detect warp fields, already exist. Virtually any interferometer could do so, and Michelson interferometers, in particular, would be pretty convenient (especially now that we know *c* is isotropic). The real problem is: what is the "device" you put near one leg to generate a warp field? Nobody has any idea what sort of physical device might make a gravitational dipole field, since no gravitational dipoles nor gravitational negative monopoles have ever been seen anywhere ever, and there are good reasons to think they can't exist. A *lot* of physics, even Newtonian stuff like the mechanics of baseballs, bullets, and BBs, would break in a big way if they did. And by "in a big way" I mean that classical mechanics would lose all predictive power essentially everywhere. Since we actually can predict the trajectories of baseballs, bullets, and BBs pretty well, we can conclude that the weirder A-warp stuff doesn't exist, and surmise that it may be because there simply aren't any gravitational dipoles anywhere.
 Probably you saw a *circumzenithal arc*, produced by a prism-like effect when light goes through atmospheric ice crystals. You can read more [here](_URL_1_) or [here](_URL_0_).
 Sorry Thegoodstuff, but I removed the post. You need to talk to a medical professional for this question for your own safety.
 As far as we know, quarks are elementary particles. So they are not made of anything "smaller". In the standard model of particle physics, [these](_URL_0_) particles are elementary.
 This is an elementary explanation (as the other explanations here are fairly technical and conflicting). If I knew how well educated you were I could give a more in depth answer but this should get the point across. Say you have a football on the surface of the earth and you want to move it to some point above the earth. Think of the amount of energy required to move it between those points as the potential energy. You must therefore supply kinetic energy (energy of motion) equal to the that potential energy. So say you throw the football into the air. The kinetic energy you supply will slowly turn into potential energy until the football reaches the maximum height. At this point the football will stop, the kinetic energy will be zero and all of the energy will be potential. You have successfully supplied the football with the required kinetic energy. The football will then fall back down, with the potential energy turning back into kinetic energy until it hits the ground. When it hits the ground it will hit it with the same amount of energy that you put into it. All of the kinetic energy will dissipate into other forms of energy like heat and sound. This is how potential and kinetic energy are related. When dealing with gravity, the rate at which kinetic energy changes into potential energy will decrease with distance (height). If you throw something far enough that it goes beyond the earth and never comes back (like in your original question), the rate at which kinetic energy changes to potential energy will continue to slow down, but never reach zero. So the trick to getting something to escape earth's gravity is to make sure it is moving fast enough to never reach that zero point discussed above. So the object will always have some kinetic energy and some potential energy. I really hope this was helpful, as it was very long and took a long time to write.
 In theory yes, but in reality you'd probably be more likely to spill it. Once you tilted the cup at all you would lose the swirl as the liquid deformed against the cup wall and that creates imbalances. You can actually try this. Stir up a liquid in a cup where the liquid mass is as great as possible relative to the cup (paper cups work well) and then pick the cup up by your fingertips. Tilt the cup to one side to disturb the vortex and you should feel the cup trying to move around in various directions as the vortex collapses and sloshes against the cup unevenly.
 The Pauli exclusion principle is derived in the nonrelativistic limit, as it assumes:* that no particle creation/destruction occurs at all, so that the system can be described by an n-fermion wavefunction* that there is a fixed background potential for the fermions creating the discrete energy levels - this is an instantaneous interaction in disguise! so that I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't violate locality, which is a relativistic prescription. The actual fundamental theory, which is a relativistic interacting quantum field theory including fermions, preserves causality and only features local correlations. However, in this theory particle number is an operator and not a constant, and all interactions must be local (so no average potentials, or actually no potentials at all), so it's considerably more complex.
 Because the earth's temperature is really only suitable for water to rain down. For everything else it's either too hot or too cold and water is abundant on earth. It would be possible for things with a similar melting point to water to rain on earth, but such compounds are not present on earth in large enough quantities. On other planets it's a different story. On Venus it rains sulfuric acid (though it evaporates before reaching the ground) and Saturn's moon titan has methane/ethane rains.
 My understanding is that it's related to very strong stimulus coupled with the nerve terminals being in close proximities. Like the classic example of referred pain during a MI: there is a "spillover" of neurotransmitters that are picked up by other dendrites that are not directly related to where the pain is coming from. So the pain is from cardiac tissue, which synapses with the spinal cord and has a massive release of neurotransmitters, which are picked up by many other neurons rather than just the intended. So you have the pain in your chest, but also feel pain in your arm. I hope this answer makes sense, it has been awhile.
 There is a theorised smallest length, called the "planck length". In short, it's the absolute minimum length that it is theoretically possible to measure, regardless of how good our measuring technology becomes. I've heard it referred to as the "pixel size of the universe", which seems fitting if it truly is the smallest possible length. [Here's the Wikipedia link for further reading](_URL_0_)
 It is my understanding that both the SA and AV nodes are innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system, which would decrease the spontaneous depolarization of both nodes simultaneously in Athlete's Heart. Also just to clarify, the lowest resting heart rate ever recorded (to my knowledge) is 28 bpm. I truly am stumped about the Bundle of His though. I would guess that since the funny Na channels are slowed in the SA and AV nodes by parasympathetics that there would be a similar mechanism occurring in the Bundle of His as well. I say this because the only common abnormal heart sound found in highly trained athletes is an S3 due to hypertrophy of the heart.
 For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume that your heat sink starts at room temperature and that "cold" in this case means less than room temperature. In this case, no. In fact, because the heat sink starts at room temperature and will be in good contact with the thing that it is cold, it will *increase* the temperature of the cold thing. Further, because heat sinks of the computer variety are specifically designed to exchange heat with their surroundings efficiently, even if the heat sink started at the same temperature as the cold thing it would speed up the rate at which the cold thing's temperature increased.
 For the same reason that ocean water is blue. Water and ice both [only absorb weakly in the visible spectrum. ](_URL_0_) However this absorption is stronger in the red part of the spectrum and weaker at the blue end. As a result, the intrinsic color of water and ice is blue. The problem is that in order to see it you need light to travel through a sufficiently thick layer of water/ice for the color to become noticeable. That is why a glass of water or an ice cube will look clear, but the ocean or a thick sheet of ice will look blue.
 It's not really a serious science question. Life started about 3-4 billion years ago and evolved into you and all life you see around you. Life changed bit by bit for each of those millions, if not billions, of generations. Eyes, wings, legs, etc. tiny step by tiny step. Picture the evolution from a tiny bacteria to you or some other living thing as a movie. Each frame in that movie is the next generation. There are millions of frames in that movie. Most of those frames are forever lost because things perish. However, we have remarkably found fossils that gives us a few frames of that movie. Essentially ever fossil ever found fit exactly into that movie as we would expect. But we can never expect to find every single frame. Imagine just finding fossils of your last 50 ancestors. That's absolutely absurd. That's the missing link. We don't have every single frame in that movie. The fact we have so many frames is actually extremely impressive.
 Here's a wikipedia article about the idea:_URL_0_In base 2.5 you'd have 3 digits: 0, 1, and 2. So 1 would just be 1, 2 would be 2, and 10 would be 2.5. What would be trickier would be a number like 3. You'd have to represent it as    ab.cdefgh... where    a * 2.5^1 + b * 2.5^0 + c * 2.5^-1 + d * 2.5^-2 + ... = 3. It'd probably be an infinitely repeating sequence after the dot. I have no idea if it's useful!
 We don't. These arguments are not sensible. First, as you say, our universe might just be dsicrete. Furthermore, if our universe is a simulation, we have no ideas what the laws of physics would be like in the "real" universe. Thus, the fact that computer simulations are discrete in our universe tells us nothing about what simulations would look like in some hypothetical "real" universe in which we are a simulation, because it is only within the simulation that discretization is a feature of computers.
 Selective pressures balance vitamin D production with UV resistance. The human body needs sunlight to produce vitamin D with skin (you can also get it through some foods). The skin also needs melanin to protect against sun damage. Closer to the equator, where there is lots of sunlight, darker skin with more melanin is selected for because it protects against sun damage. Light skin is selected against because the intense radiation from the sun will damage the skin. Further away from the equator, there is less sunlight. Lighter skin is selected for to produce more vitamin D. Darker skin is selected against because it would result in vitamin D deficiency. Less sunlight relaxes the constraint of preventing sun damage. In places where people get vitamin D from their diets (such as the Inuit) they still have dark skin, because dark skin is the primitive trait. Nowadays those selective pressures don't matter as much due to clothing, sunscreen, vitamin-rich diets, etc.
 There are a few points to make here. Firstly, this is probably partly answered by evolutionary serendipity. It was important for life to largely use one enantiomer over the other because enzymes work on the principle of shapes fitting in their active sites. Different enantiomers are different shapes. Once one enantiomer became more prevalent, it would have been evolutionarily unfavorable for an organism to use the other one. It would have had to synthesize all it's amino acids rather than just scooping up the one's in the environment from organisms it had 'eaten'. Thus, the isomer that 'won' early on would have been locked in; natural selection wouldn't allow the other one to become more plentiful. Having said that, there are examples of D-amino acids being used, particularly in the cell walls of Gram positive bacteria. One idea is that this is a defensive mechanism since peptidases can't recognize them. The other interesting point to my mind is why L amino acids became dominant. It could have just been luck, but there is also the suggestion that L amino acids are slightly more stable than the opposite form (they interact differently with polarized light), and so may have become more prevalent in the primordial environment when life was just getting started.
 It's called vasovagal syncope. It's caused by the vagus nerve. Some info:_URL_0_This nerve can be responsible for some very weird reactions indeed.
 States of matter only apply to collections of atoms. Single atoms are not solids, liquids or gases. An isolated atom does not have a temperature or pressure, these quantities are only meaningful in the context of multiple atoms. When you dissolve a solid into a liquid, assuming it completely dissolves and doesn't leave solid particles behind, it's a liquid solution. When the solid dissolved all of its atoms/molecules were separated and mixed into the solvent. All of the solid properties were lost, and the result is just a liquid made of more than one species of atom/molecule. If a large solid breaks into smaller pieces that are still solid but disperse themselves throughout the liquid, it's called a suspension or a colloid, depending on the size of the dispersoid. The bottom line is that "state of matter" is not a fundamental, immutable property that atoms carry with them. States of matter are emergent behaviors that depend on the interactions between atoms.
 Yes - and it is easy to test. Also, you know those fake weasels that are tethered to a ball so it looks like they are playing with it, rolling it around on the floor? The spinning motor inside the ball is attached to the ball and still it moved.
 [Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder: what do we know after 50 years? ](_URL_0_)2003 > ‘Flashbacks’ following use of hallucinogenic drugs have been reported for decades; they are recognized in DSM-IV as ‘HallucinogenPersistingPerceptionDisorder (Flashbacks)’, or HPPD. We located and analyzed 20 quantitative studies between 1955 and 2001 examining this phenomenon. However, many of these studies were performed before operational criteria for HPPD were published in DSM-III-R, so they are difficult to interpret in the light of current diagnostic criteria. Overall, current knowledge of HPPD remains very limited. In particular (1) the term ‘flashbacks’ is defined in so many ways that it is essentially valueless; (2) most studies provide too little information to judge how many cases could meet DSM-IV criteria for HPPD; and consequently (3) information about risk factors for HPPD, possible etiologic mechanisms, and potential treatment modalities must be interpreted with great caution. At present, HPPD appears to be a genuine but uncommon disorder, sometimes persisting for months or years after hallucinogen use and causing substantial morbidity. It is reported most commonly after illicit LSD use, but less commonly with LSD administered in research or treatment settings, or with use of other types of hallucinogens. There are case reports, but no randomized controlled trials, of successful treatment with neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and clonidine. Although it may be difficult to collect large samples of HPPD cases, further studies are critically needed to augment the meager data presently available regarding the prevalence, etiology, and treatment of HPPD. Just use google scholar for case studies and theories. Try /r/homework help if you get stuck.
 There's actually a good deal of research on the heritability of height. Note that this refers *not* to specifically how tall you will be, but rather speaks in terms of 'how much of the variation in height is determined by genetics'. [This paper](_URL_2_) says that  > Heritability for body weight, height, and BMI was low at birth (between 6.4 and 8.7% for boys, and between 4.8 and 7.9% for girls) but increased over time, accounting for close to half or more of the variance in body weight and BMI after 5 months of age in both sexes. [This paper](_URL_3_) says > Adult height is a classic polygenic trait of high narrow-sense heritability (h (2) = 0.8). [This paper](_URL_0_) proposes some mechanisms by looking at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): > We show that 45% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. [This study](_URL_1_) looked at twin studies in Sweden > Additive genetic factors explained 81% of variation in height, 59% in body mass index and 50-60% in the strength measures.
 Yes it does. The ISS orbits every 90 minutes so one side is always facing Earth. They do this (And i'm making an educated guess) for science and to control motion sickness. If the ISS was stationary, it would 'appear' to rotate from earth's point of view. The orientation of the ISS is controlled by Zero Propellant Manoeuvre (ZPM - not the one used in stargate) guided by the Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMG). Thrusters are also used for altitude and to avoid space debris etc.
 There is work being done right now to show that the speed of healing is variable and controlled by genetics. In [this](_URL_0_) study, "fast healing" mice with the gene healed 4 times faster than their "slow healing" counterparts.
 i actually just studied this in a biology class a couple weeks ago. my knowledge is incomplete on the subject, but i think i have a solid enough grasp to be able to give you an answer, at least to the problem of potassium. when in a normal resting state, the amount of sodium ions outside the cell is greater than inside the cell, and potassium is greater inside the cell than outside. when a stimulus occurs that is strong enough to trigger voltage-gate sodium ion channels, sodium begins to flow into the cell in large amounts. this is what triggers the electrical change in the cell membrane to allow signals to travel. at the peak of action potential, voltage-gated potassium ion channels open, allowing potassium to flow out of the cell, bringing the charge of the cell back to the resting potential statenow, what would happen if there wasn't enough potassium? the cell would have to wait for the sodium ions to flow back out of the cell through the sodium-potassium pump in order to bring itself back to resting potential. the "cramp" caused by potassium deficiency is basically the cells taking longer to return to resting potential. basically, sodium ions trigger action potential, potassium ions stop action potential.
 To determine which strategy is optimal, you need to know something about how the individual values different amounts of money and how they value risk. In general, the utility that one dollar offers to someone like Bill Gates is much, much less than the utility it offers to someone below the poverty line. This results in people being risk-averse, in that they get more expected *utility* out of a strategy that has the same expected financial gain (or even somewhat less) but less risk. As a simple example, it wouldn't generally be a good idea to bet your house against something 50% more valuable on a coin flip, because while you would have an expected gain financially, the utility gained by having the extra money is much less than the utility lost by becoming homeless. In the case of Deal or No Deal, that means that, for some people, it may be worthwhile to take the deal even if that option gives less expected financial gain. In this case, it's not because they might lose their house, obviously, but because the difference that $1,000,000 will make in most people's lives, while significant, is not ten times the difference that $100,000 will make. On the other hand, there are certain extreme circumstances under which this phenomenon can be reversed. A simple example is when a particular threshold needs to be met to make a big change in someone's life, and small gains don't make any progress towards this. To use an example from a stats course I TA'd this semester, if a contestant owed money to the Mafia, say $500,000, and they were going to kill him if he couldn't pay them, then to that contestant the utility of any amount less than $500,000 would be practically nothing, while the utility of any amount over $500,000 would be enormous. Playing Deal or No Deal, the contestant would want to refuse any offer under $500,000, regardless of how it compared to the expected value, so long as any case with more than $500,000 is left.
 The [Pati-Salam model](_URL_0_) supposedly does not predict proton decay, unless it's embedded in a larger model that predicts it. This model does, however, predict magnetic monopoles, which like proton decay, are not observed in nature. It also suggests that quarks have four color charges and not three, for which there is also no evidence. > is proton decay a necessary part of any theory that unifies the forces? Well, we don't know. Only one such unification can be correct. Whether that unification will have proton decay or not, we don't know yet. Only time will tell. Surely we can build models without proton decay, but that doesn't mean they are correct. All of them to date, both with and without proton decay, have not been successful. So we aren't sure.
 It should help the shave. Instead of pushing the wedge of the blade straight against and perpendicular to the hair, the vibration creates a sawing effect. On a microscopic level, there are tiny imperfections in the blade edge. These act as serrations, as on a steak knife. If the blade were then to vibrate (let's say it moves in a random direction a short, fixed distance along a plane), the serrations would tend to make the blade saw through the hair with less bending. The bending of the hair tends to create a cut surface that isn't flush with the skin. Therefore, the sawing will increase the flatness of the shorn hairs—a closer shave.
 Even though the electromagnetic disruption from a CME is temporary, if it is powerful enough to fry every transformer, computer chip, and electrical switching station in the country, they would all need to be physically replaced, and that would take a much longer time.
 Dogs (and also cats and some other animals) cannot close their lips like we do, so they cannot suck the water (create underpressure in their mouths). As far as I know, it has to do with them being carnivores, with a less "closed up" mouth, they can put more teeth in their prey while hunting.
 The nuclues of mature granular white blood cells is pyknotic. It has collapsed and is not capable of further mRNA production. In neutrophils is collapses into the multilobes structure we recognize. In eosinophils it is two lobes. In red blood cells teh pyknotic nucleus is extruded. Neutrophils can no longer repoduce or differentiate. All process happen through activation of the present components.
 Probably slightly. Maple syrup is mostly sugar water, which is not very conductive, but there would also be other ions and minerals in the syrup since the sap is the "blood" of the tree so it contains all the necessary chemicals for survival. I think a bigger drawback is the price of maple syrup, due to the monopoly controlled by the quebec union of producers
 Here is my guess and explanation of that guess:  [Aluminium is usually produced by extracted from bauxite, an ore made from a mixture of aluminium hydroxide, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and kaolinite. Because it is so reactive aluminium cannot be extracted economically using chemical processes; instead it is extracted by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process. The Hall-Héroult process uses a huge amount of electricity; hundreds of thousands of amperes are used in each cell and a single plant may contain hundreds of cells connected in series. According to Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, the best smelters use about 13 kilowatt hours (46.8 megajoules) of electrical energy to produce one kilogram of aluminium; the worldwide average is closer to 15 kWh/kg (54 MJ/kg). ](_URL_0_)Now the [top operational primary aluminium smelter in the world by capacity](_URL_1_), as of December 2012 was:  Name: Huomei Hongjun Aluminium Smelter  Country: China  City: Hongjun  Capacity in tonnes per year (tpy): 1,060,000  OK, so 1 tonne is 1,000 kg, and let's assume the average efficiency of 15 kWh/kg, so we get 15 * 1,060,000 * 1000 = 15,900,000,000 kWh worth of energy consumption per year. That is 1.59e^+13 watt-hours or if your prefer about 15.9 terawatt-hours worth of electrical ~~power~~ *energy* per year. Each watt-hour is 3600 joules, so that comes to about 57.2 petajoules per year. *(Caveat: I hope I got all the prefixes correct)*.
 Are you asking for which other genes/operons do Repressors exist? If so, it's not all that uncommmon, many important small molecules in metabolism are under pretty tight regulation. Lactose is not especially unique in this regard. The Lac repressor is the one that is taught is it was one of the very first whose mode of action was experimentally discovered and characterised. It's something of a canonical example as it is clear and easy to teach. There are whole families of sugar based repressors (GalR, TreR). Other classic examples are the amino acid repressor systems (Met, Tyr and Trp being 3 examples). There are nucleotide repressor systems (PurR)
 Most traditional cultures that I have encountered hug. I'm sure there are some cultures around that do not. Part of the reason people DO hug is because deep pressure stimulates the para-sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a calming feeling.
 There are two main properties in play here, mass and distance. The influence from gravity drops off pretty quickly with distance, so the amount of mass required to create a significant acceleration depends on how far away you are. In a vastly simplified universe with only two particles in it, they would influence each other to some degree no matter how far apart they were. Basically everything in the visible universe is influencing you gravitationally to some degree, but it's drowned out by closer and more significant sources.
 [It's not really hydrophobia in a psychological sense. ](_URL_0_)  The rabies virus causes muscle paralysis, which manifests as difficulty swallowing due to jaw and throat paralysis. When drinking water, the patient will panic due to an inability to swallow. Combine this with the agitation/confusion associated with rabies and it looks like hydrophobia.
 Supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies still are only a small amount of the total mass of the galaxy. The Milky Way's, for instance, is only about 4 million times the mass of the Sun, while the galaxy is about 100 billion times the mass of the Sun. The stars in the Galaxy contribute about 20,000 times more to the gravitational potential in the Milky Way than the black hole in the center. The black hole can be safely ignored in calculations unless one is considering specifically the volume very close to it. Moreover, dark matter was needed to explain the fast motion of stars at large distances from the centers of galaxies, where the mass of the black hole at the center is entirely negligible. The motions of stars closer in are much closer to what one expects for Keplerian orbits. (This isn't the only evidence for dark matter by now, just what got the ball rolling.)
 Disclaimer: I'm transgender. Obvious bias is obvious. This is a copypasta from a comment from six months ago where the original asker challenged that transgender people don't, citing a pubmed source, hence why all of these were found from a brief search on the same engine:* [Our results confirmed previously reported deviances of brain activation patterns in transsexual men from men without GID and also corroborated these findings in a group of transsexual patients receiving cross-sex hormone therapy. ](_URL_8_)* [These findings provide new evidence that transsexualism is associated with distinct cerebral pattern, which supports the assumption that brain anatomy plays a role in gender identity. ](_URL_10_)* [We have shown previously that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) is female in size and neuron number in male-to-female transsexual people. In the present study we investigated the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus, which is composed of two subnuclei, namely interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH) 3 and 4. ... We propose that the sex reversal of the INAH3 in transsexual people is at least partly a marker of an early atypical sexual differentiation of the brain and that the changes in INAH3 and the BSTc may belong to a complex network that may structurally and functionally be related to gender identity. ](_URL_3_)* [The present findings of somatostatin neuronal sex differences in the BSTc and its sex reversal in the transsexual brain clearly support the paradigm that in transsexuals sexual differentiation of the brain and genitals may go into opposite directions and point to a neurobiological basis of gender identity disorder. ](_URL_11_)* [RESULTS: GID subjects had a significant decrease in rCBF in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right insula compared to control subjects. ...

 I'm not entirely sure about the standards of this journal, but it does have citations. I'll try to sum up the author's major points that are at least supported by studies:1) Reading online requires much more "cognitive space" for a number of different reasons. The use of hyperlinks embedded within texts leads to more decision-making to be made, which of course requires more use of the brain. Just like when reading a paper newspaper, when one is confronted with many different choices in terms of what to read, one needs to make more cognitive decisions in selecting the most appealing thing to read. Also, websites that require scrolling to read the full text leads to greater brain activation that websites that do not require scrolling. 2) The framework of the text (paratext) has an influence on the reader's response to the text. In a normal book, we have the acknowledgements page, title page, etc. that all shape our view that "we are reading a book". Similarly, a study showed that subjects were more likely to perceive humor in a text when reading on a lighter, clearer device. 3) Online multitasking while reading on a screen most likely leads to a reduction in comprehension of and "deeper" thinking about the text. However, a link between reading comprehension and reading on paper vs screen is still not definitive, because studies have found conflicting results. This is clearly still an emerging field of study, as e-readers and e-books have only become popular in recent years. I'll be curious to see what the results are from more careful scientific studies. _URL_0_Barry W Cull, "Reading Revolutions: Online digital text and implications for reading in academe"
 Yes. Math is the same in all bases.
 Cool! A question I can answer. The equation for a spring is F=kx, where F is the spring force created by the spring, K is the spring constant, and x is the displacement of the end of the spring. K is constant as long as the spring isn't stretched too far. So, you have F/k=x. You're asking if you double gravity, will it double the displacement? Well, force due to gravity is mass times acceleration due to gravity, so mg.We now have mg/k=x. The mass stays the same regardless of the planet, as well as K. So, if you double the gravitational  constant G, the displacement, x, will also double. This is all based on material I've learned in my physics course this year, so if I'm wrong on any of this, I'd like to know before my finals in a few weeks.
 Millikelvin is frequently used in low temperature physics. [Random example](_URL_0_). Kilo, mega kelvin etc aren't really used. If systems have that high a temperature it's usually discussed in terms of energy. [Actually, that's not true, I stand corrected](_URL_1_)
 No, different isotopes will emit different gamma frequencies when they decay. Nuclear chemists take advantage of that fact to identify which isotopes might be in an unknown sample through a technique called [gamma spectroscopy](_URL_0_).

 Same thing that happens to the rest of your body. They get sun burned. Also known as photokeratitis. And just like your skin. Your eyes will swell and burn and the cells will die off and shed. You’ll need to get antibiotics because if your eyes get infected they can scar over and become opaque. Usually it clears up in a couple days (much like sunburn on the rest of the body). Continued excessive sun exposure to the eyes can lead to cataracts and cancer.
 For clarification, why do people talk out loud to themselves, like when they read items off a list when grocery shopping, or when they repeat a funny joke to themselves?

 Boron stops fission in a reactor because it absorbs the neutrons which continue the chain reaction. A fusion reactor isn't quite a chain reaction in the same sense. In a good fusion reactor the energy released by fusion will heat the plasma and allow more fusion to happen, but it isn't a straight-forward cause and effect like in fission with a neutron triggering the next event. I don't know how the rate will be controlled in the upcoming fusion reactors, though I imagine it simply involves adjusting the temperature and the fuel density. In a deuterium-tritium reactor, a neutron *is* emitted with each fusion. One possible scheme for producing more tritium fuel is to line the reactor walls with lithium, which the neutron will break up into helium and tritium. I don't know whether they plan on using boron to limit that reaction. Hopefully a fusion reactor expert will stop by and elaborate on those last details, but I think these are the key issues at least.
 Check out [this Youtube video](_URL_2_) which explains it. An alkaline battery consists two two half cells that's undergoing [these redox reactions](_URL_1_). Note that there is water as the product of the first half-reaction, and water as the reactant in the second half-reaction. As the battery is discharged, water is produced in the first half-cell (the inner cylinder in the [Wikipedia article diagram](_URL_0_)), and water is consumed in the second half-cell (the outside compartment). So the charge state of the battery will affect the density of the respective half-cells, and therefore the structural characteristics.
 You could have 0 ground speed, but the airspeed would have to be above the stall speed. The plane would have to be tethered, or it would just blow away in the wind. This is why small planes are tied down. Even if the wind isn't enough to maintain flight it creates lift, reducing friction with the ground. Just using random numbers, a 2000lb plane could have 1500lbs lift, so its net weight is 500lbs. With the large surface area and small contact patches (tires) even a light wind can toss a small plane.
 There are sweat glands located on the footpads of dogs so it is thought that this is done as a way of spreading their scent around in the dirt to mark territory. This behavior may be more excessive if the dog detects the area has already been "marked" by another dog. The visible action of kicking up the dirt this way may also be meant to be seen by other dogs in the nearby area as a display of dominance.
 The short answer is "no". Wernicke's and Broca's areas are defined as understanding/generating language/speech. Most of the early research was based on lesions in these areas or through stroke. Currently we somewhat further understand these through fMRI (neuroimaging). Animals have communication systems, but nothing near language. Their communication is also extremely limited in temporality, and all but non-existent in combinational aspects.
 It would be pretty rare for there to be fog in a cave. Fog pretty much forms when the temperature drops, reducing the water capacity of the air, thus causing it to condense in place, forming microscopic droplets that we call fog. While many caves will be pretty much at 100% humidity (especially those here on the west (wet) coast of Canada), they do not see the temperature swing required to form fog.
 for what evidence and observations we have so far, the dark matter does not participate in electromagnetic interaction, only in gravitational one. that means it does not interact with photons and thus does not emit or absorb light. and that is why we cannot see it at all. given the fact the most of our knowledge about the space and the things from afar come through seeing emitted or reflected by various objects light, we can only speculate about the nature of dark matter. the only way we get our knowledge is gravitational interaction. when the dark matter cloud tugs on a near star we can see the star is deviating from its supposed path and make some implication on the mass and distribution of the object that makes the star move in the way we see it moves. maybe when we have starfaring laboratories we'll get close to dark matter and actually try to scoop it in a flask.
 Essentially this same question was [asked](_URL_0_) about 10 days ago, but:There's really no such thing as "infinite radius" because infinity is not a number and doesn't behave like a number. That said, in some situations, it's convenient to think of straight lines as being (in some sense) circles "of infinite radius" (with center at infinity). That's not very rigorous though, and isn't perfectly compatible with the notion of circles of finite radius.
 Well, first thing first but you can't use radiocarbon dating on pottery because radiocarbon dating requires there to be a significant amount of carbon in the artifact you are dating. Since clay is primarily alumina silicate, you can't really date pottery. What archaeologists usually date is archaeological wood, especially carbonized wood from hearths or other fires. From [the Beta Analytic website](_URL_0_), one of the labs that American archaeologists use most frequently to do their radiocarbon testing: > The unstable and radioactive carbon 14, called radiocarbon, is a naturally occurring isotope of the element carbon. When a living thing dies, it stops interacting with the biosphere, and the carbon 14 in it remains unaffected by the biosphere but will naturally undergo decay. > Decay of carbon 14 takes thousands of years, and it is this wonder of nature that forms the basis of radiocarbon dating and made this carbon 14 analysis a powerful tool in revealing the past. > The process of radiocarbon dating starts with the analysis of the carbon 14 left in a sample. The proportion of carbon 14 in the sample examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since death of the sample’s source. Radiocarbon dating results are reported in uncalibrated years BP (Before Present), where BP is defined as AD 1950. Calibration is then done to convert BP years into calendar years. This information is then related to true historical dates. The relation to true historical dates they mention at the end there is usually accomplished through comparing a radiocarbon curve to a dendrochronology (or tree-ring dating) curve. Dendrochronology is actually the most precise and accurate dating method to archaeologists in that it (usually) gives you an exact date when the tree you are looking at was cut down (and presumably used shortly there after, although that can be a complication in some places/instances). You can then double check your radiocarbon results by correlating a radiocarbon curve with this dendrochronology to help account for changes in atmospheric levels of carbon 14 and other variance in the curve produced through radiocarbon. There are some limitations to radiocarbon dating however. First of all, there are upper and lower limits to how old an object you can date through radiocarbon. Anything very recent has undergone too little decay of C14 to be able to date it reliably. Additionally, anything older than about 50,000 years ago can't be reliably dates through radiocarbon because the proportion of C14 is so small that it can't be reliably measured. There are also a couple "plateaus" in the radiocarbon curve were any dates from within that time range all produce the same dates. For instance, the most problematic plateau for archaeologists is the plateau between about 2800 and 2400BP (800-400BC). Anything that dates to within that period just dates to that entire range instead of any more specific time range within it. That could still be potentially useful, but usually we want to make distinctions that are more fine-grained than a 400 year period. Additionally, cross-contamination can be a real problem. This happens usually by introducing modern carbon to a sample, therefore making it appear older than it actually is by increasing the proportion of C12 to C14 through the addition of modern C12. This most famously might have occurred at the Meadowcroft Rock Shelter which has a seam of coal running nearby, potentially contaminating any radiocarbon dates from the cave. Generally, archaeologists are trained and very good about not adding the contamination themselves when they excavate and transport radiocarbon samples, but they also have to be vigilant about possible sources of contamination within the archaeologist site (like the coal seam I mentioned above). There are some potential issues in interpreting the date of an object dated through radiocarbon. The radiocarbon date just tells us when the organism it came form died, not necessarily when it was used by humans. In the case of huge logs used to build structures, there isn't any really reason to assume these objects weren't used fairly shortly after they were cut down. If you leave a log laying around for decades it won't generally be very usable for construction any more. However, in some places such as ancestral Pueblos in the U.S. Southwest we have evidence for the reuse of these huge logs in later buildings. Because of this, the archaeologist can't just blindly accept the radiocarbon date as the date of the building. They have to look at the actual architecture and determine, if they can, if the wood has been reused from older parts of the building and so if the building is actually younger than the radiocarbon would suggest. You get a similar effect when using charcoal from hearths, especially in areas with scarce wood. A lot of times, people are potentially using "old wood" they scavenge off the ground for cooking and camp fires. Unlike wood for architecture, you can burn this old wood just as well as freshly acquired wood, and so the dates taken from a hearth might have some more variability in their date range than you would otherwise expect if they are using only contemporary growing wood for fires. However, just like with the architecture, the careful archaeologist can account for a lot of that variance [by carefully examining the "formation processes"](_URL_1_) through which the radiocarbon samples ended up where they did. The most important take away here is that you should never trust just one radiocarbon date. Any respectable archaeologist is going to run as many radiocarbon dates as they can on an archaeological site so that any outliers dates end up sticking out very obviously, or alternatively, so that a huge range of variance in the dates tells you that maybe something else is going on that would be influencing the radiocarbon results. Most archaeologists are very good about not just taking radiocarbon dates on their face value and actually examining them in the context of the archaeological site they found them in. Another concern is making sure that you radiocarbon samples come from really tightly controlled contexts with the other objects you want to date. If you get some charcoal from a fire pit inside a house, you can reasonably date that house using the radiocarbon date from the fire pit even though you are not dating the house directly. If you just find some charcoal in the dirt covering an archaeological site, and it isn't associated with human materials, you can't rule out the possibility of it being naturally occurring charcoal that was introduced to the site in some way. Again, archaeologists being very careful should usually not have a problem with these sorts of concerns as long as they work to address them from the start (which most do). That said, radiocarbon dating is, alongside dendrochronology, one of the most useful and revolutionary dating techniques in archaeology and is extremely well tested in its validity and applications. There is definitely misuse of radiocarbon dating, but don't be skeptical of the technique as a whole, just in particular cases. Finally, as for other dating techniques, there is really a dizzying number of techniques archaeologists use so I won't go through all of them, but some you might be interested in looking into include thermoluminescence dating, optical dating, potassium-thorium series and potassium-argon series dating. Other techniques archaeologists use to accomplish relative dating is through stratigraphy (so older things are further down, so the pot we found near the surface is more recent than the ones we find below) as well as generalizing styles of artifacts alongside more specific dating techniques. If we have several archaeological sites were a particular style of pottery is found in association with radiocarbon dates that all point to the same time period, we can reasonably conclude that other sites we find with that pottery at least date to that date range.
 For a few reasons depending on the medicine. Some medicine is best absorbed in an acidic environment (with food, as more acid is produced for digestion) and others in a less acidic environment (without food). In addition to this you can't forget that medicine is really just chemicals and therefore may react with certain foods or nutrients (like calcium) making them less effective. Another common reason for taking medicine with meals that has nothing to do with bioabsorbtion is to protect the stomach as some medicines are harsh on the stomach and can affect the stomach lining such as aspirin. There are other reasons but these are a few.
 I'm not sure what you mean by the "speed" of vision, but humans take approximately 190ms to respond to a visual stimulus [\[source\]](_URL_0_).
 In my personal experience monitoring EEGs, I have seen approximately seven people die while being monitored. In each case, the EEG went flat before the EKG did, indicating definite loss of consciousness before the heart stopped beating. Generally if the heart stops beating suddenly from an otherwise healthy state the mean arterial pressure (MAP, read as: **blood pressure**) is going to start decreasing fairly fast. Lack of sufficient blood flow to the brainstem will cause unconsciousness faster than hypoxia would, and once the cerebral perfusion pressure drops below 50 the brain can't really autoregulate its blood flow anymore. The brainstem houses among many other things the **reticular activating system** a set of nuclei with widespread connections that appear to be necessary for the waking, conscious state. Underperfusion of these nuclei will lead to loss of consciousness. In the immediate aftermath of clinical death,  brain cells will quickly exhaust energy stores as they are highly metabolically active. Without ATP, the brain cannot power its Na-K pumps and will quickly lose their voltage and ion gradients, coming to equilibrium with the fluid between cells. Their organelles will stop working and the cells will be dead. They will wait in that state until the processes of decomposition begin to break them down.
 Imagine an antenna in empty infinite space, and two invisible spheres around it. One has a radius of 1 meter and one has a radius of 1 light year. Now the antenna is radiating a pulse of 1W power for 1s, the emitted waves will be like a spherical shell, 1 lightsecond thick, and the total energy inside that shell will be 1 Joule. Because it is in empty space, that 1J will never dissipate. Because of that, and because in empty space no energy will be added or subtracted to the system, the power that goes through the inner sphere of the at 1 metre radius will be the same as the power that goes through the surface of the outer sphere at 1 light year radius. Which means that although total power/energy stays the same, power/energy density does get thinner and thinner the further we go from the radiating structure. If you imagine a lone antenna somewhere in the universe, then after a certain point that 1 Joule will spread out so much as to be undetectable by any means that we have or can conceive.
 This may not be exactly what you mean, but lots of organisms are polyploid- having more than two complete sets of chromosomes. Most are plants, flatworms, etc. In looking up a list to give you I learned that certain trout have been engineered to be triploid (3 sets of chromosomes). They aren't fertile, which is apparently the point- the fish don't expend energy on reproduction so they get bigger which makes them more appealing to anglers. Similarly, the genetically modified salmon currently under investigation for FDA approval (aqua advantage salmon) have been modified to be triploid so they cannot reproduce in the wild. I don't consider Wikipedia to be a great resource normally, but this is a pretty good rundown of polyploidy- both what it means and which organisms have it. [polyploidy](_URL_0_)Now, if what you're asking is if animals experience extra single chromosomes (rather than an entire set) than the answer that it's certainly possible but probably rare since most of the time even in humans such a mutation results in a non-viable embryo or at the very least offspring that doesn't survive. /u/richardbjkelly explained it quite well so I won't go into it further.
 From the /r/linguistics FAQ: >  Which language has the most words? >  >  It's popular to say that English has the most words based upon simply counting the number of dictionary lemmas. Linguists tend to avoid answering this question because what constitutes a "word" is difficult to pin down, and any precise definition of a word would probably unfairly exclude other languages. A word in English is a very easy concept to grasp because English is an isolating language that strongly prefers discrete words over morphemes. Wait, what does all that mean? I'll explain. >   >  Consider the English noun dog. It has a very limited number of inflectional morphemes that can modify the meaning of the word. An  < s >  affixed to the end can become a plural marker dogs. So the word dog has two forms. (We are not considering free and archaic morphemes for now). That's such a low number of morphological changes that most English speakers will not even notice. Such a low degree of variation in each word means that English is an isolating language, like Mandarin Chinese, and that the concept of a word is very simple. >   >  World languages are rarely so isolating. Most languages include more morphological possibilities, and linguists call them agglutinating languages. Spanish is mildly agglutinating: suffixes can distinguish the gender of a dog (perro versus perra), size (mujer "woman," mujercita "little woman," mujerona "large woman"), incident (cabeza "head," (el) cabezazo "headbutt, header (in football)"), as well as take on idiomatic senses (soltera "bachelorette" but solterona "spinster"). >   >  On the extreme end of agglutination are polysynthetic languages which are capable of fusing extraordinary sums of morphemes onto a single root noun. Polysynthesis can make a single word say what would take English an entire sentence of words (see Do Eskimos have 40 words for snow?). So it is understandable that polysynthetic languages like Yupik would have fewer root nouns than an isolating language like English. This does not mean that Yupik is crippled or incapable of expressing the full range of human communication. What needs to be reconsidered is the definition of a word. ============So, yeah, the notion what it means to be a word anyway is tricky. See [Dixon  &  Aikhenvald (2003) "Word: A typological framework"](_URL_0_) published in [Dixon  &  Aikhenvald (2003) *Word: A Cross-linguistic Typology*](_URL_2_) for a nice overview. ------Edit: also see some discussion [here](_URL_1_) in response to a claim that English has more words than any other known language.
 When you try to model the behavior of many bodies at once, the amount of information you need to completely describe the system goes up tremendously. We are fortunate that there are many cases where we can simplify things and still make predictions about what happens. In a solid object, we can focus on the motion of the center of mass and rotations around that point, reducing some number of free parameters on the order of Avogadro's number needed to completely describe all the atoms down to a handful of free parameters needed to predict the macroscopic motions. In an ideal gas at equilibrium, we can assume the range of velocities and positions of each particle average out, so that the gas produces a near uniform pressure provided we specify the particle density and temperature of the gas. But we don't always get so lucky. Once a gas is out of equilibrium, there are correlations between the velocities of neighboring particles that create forces on other objects. By treating the gas as a continuous fluid, we can simplify this motion by describing the velocity of some arbitrary number of small regions of the gas. But for some cases the motion of the fluid is still impossible to predict for very long. Small changes in the velocity of some region in the gas can lead to large changes in how many neighboring regions behave a bit later. This is characteristic of chaotic systems in general. For a given fluid, the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow is characterized by the [Reynolds number](_URL_0_). At high Reynolds number, the inertia of the fluid starts to become important leading to eddies and vortices that can behave chaotically.
 This is a good question. I would need to check some of my books in the office tomorrow, but I feel like this is a compound nuclear reaction. The two nuclei fuse together and form an excited compound nucleus of He-5. This subsequently evaporates off a neutron quickly (10^-21 s). I did find this nice source that explains things with words and math. _URL_0_Since the decay time is longer than the transit time for a nucleon moving through the system, it is not a direct reaction. This is not a weak decay.
 Technically 2 people could repopulate the earth and if they have enough children and they only reproduce with their brothers and sisters, the next children would be viable. However, there would be a major genetic bottle neck and they will have a problem with inbreeding from the get go and it'll likely die out by the 3rd generation do to inbreeding problems. It's not until 32 people could you get a stable population. (Needing source, can't find it, but I remember reading it somewhere)There is one known point when the world population was significantly lowered. The Toba volcanic eruption occurred some 70,000 to 75,000 years ago. "The six year long volcanic winter and 1000-year-long instant Ice Age that followed Mount Toba's eruption may have decimated Modern Man's entire population. Genetic evidence suggests that Human population size fell to about 10,000 adults between 50 and 100 thousand years ago." _URL_1_Genetic evidence suggests that all humans alive today, despite apparent variety, are descended from a very small population, perhaps between 1,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs about 70,000 years ago.

 No. The Lagrangian points are defined when you have a very massive primary body (e.g. the Sun), a second body of an intermediate mass (e.g. a planet) and a satellite of negligible mass. If there are other bodies in the system then there are lots of gravitational perturbations so the whole thing stops working. In the solar system we have Lagrangian points between the Sun and planets, but only because planets are too far away from each other to make significant perturbations. The galaxy is really full of stars, and if we count dark matter things get worse. So even if you could define them in theory, a hypothetical satellite in those points will not be stable. It will follow its own orbit around the galaxy instead of being dominated by the Sun. Small detail, the galactic center may be overwhelmingly massive if compared to the Sun, but not much if compared to the galaxy. It doesn't behave like a central attracting body with lots of satellites; rather, its the addition of all stars and dark matter that makes things rotate (and dark matter influences much more than stars).
 When it arises from suddenly standing up, it is called [orthostatic hypotension](_URL_0_), an inability of your body to increase blood pressure quick enough to keep oxygen levels in your brain high enough to remain fully conscious.

 No. Observation, associated with wavefunction collapse or "state reduction", is a non-unitary, irreversible process. It happens when a quantum system becomes entangled with a classical environment. On the other hand, the laws that govern the interaction of quantum systems are unitary, which means they are completely reversible. Two quantum systems can be entangled with each other and stay in quantum superpositions forever with no wavefunction collapse / state reduction, so it's not true that one particle observes another one. Using the term "classical environment" is obviously a cop-out, since the environment is made out of a lot of quantum systems. What you're asking about is actually a big problem in the foundations of quantum mechanics, called the "[measurement problem](_URL_1_)", i.e. what exactly does it mean to make a measurement; how can this be made consistent with the idea that everything is made of quantum systems. Edit: And therefore, since it's still an open problem, no-one can give you a definitive answer. In some interpretations of quantum mechanics, the wavefunction doesn't actually collapse, but instead comes very close to collapsing, giving the impression of a classical world. One such interpretation is [decoherence](_URL_0_). In this interpretation, there's no fundamental distinction between observation and not-observation, but more of a sliding scale with entangled quantum states at one end and classical observations at the other.
 _URL_0_Why: the ability to change the sugars on the erythrocyte membrane provides resistance to pathogenic organisms (parasites, bacteria and viruses). This could be because the pathogens bind the sugars to gain entry into the cells, or because they have similar sugars on their own cell surface and so do not provoke an immune response from the host. When: predates humans, as non-humans have different blood types too so you have to go back further.
 As always, [Wikipedia has an introduction](_URL_0_). Do you expect a random reddit comment to be better than the consensus of many different authors accumulated over years? This works if you have a more specialized question, that might not be covered well in Wikipedia, but for a general overview Wikipedia articles are hard to beat. Otherwise someone would have improved the article already.
 Human fecal matter carries with it any known pathogens or diseases that the host has and can be transferred to whatever it's used in. Treated human feces can be used to fertilize but the cost of treating it surpasses the benefits of having it as fertilizer.
 Hi /u/moonshieId--There is a good reason you are confused: it's because the lengths of time associated with evolution are so large, it isn't easy to put it into context. We can look at our brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers and see the similarity. And when we look at our cousins and others, we see a little less. When you take that learning over 100 year scale and apply it to times 1,000,000 times larger, it's tough to imagine what we will see in our most distant cousins separated by millions of years. Birds today are separated from the Cretaceous dinosaurs by 65 million years, but humans are separated from living mammals like whales and mice by about the same. Mammals share a lot of details like hair and milk that would be tough to see if we only looked at bones, and most of the major groups of mammals are only divided by 65 million years. In comparison, the major groups of dinosaurs lived from 250 million years ago to 65 million years ago, so 185 million years in time. So, thinking about the diversity we see in mammals, it's no surprise that dinosaurs who ruled for 3 times as long have a lot of variation, too!
 It's possible that an electrochemical cell has been created by the cast iron + the aluminium foil. The anode would be the more reactive aluminium foil causing it to oxidise and dissolve. The cathode would be the iron. This would be facilitate by contact between the metals (electrodes). How likely this is, however, is unclear. I couldn't seem to find any other instances of this occurring. The food may be readily dissolving some of the iron into solution. However, aluminium foil typically has a protective layer of oxide and this would have to be removed first to establish a differnece in chemical potential in the watery food. It is unlikely that acids in the food would be able to remove this oxide - this is why we use aluminium foil for food preparation as it's actually very inert. This kind of setup - a piece of metal in contact with another - is used to protect ships from rusting. Pieces of zinc are bolted onto iron ship hulls and this contact facilitates the establishment of an electrochemical cell with the salty water being the electrolyte. The zinc, being more reactive, acts as a (edit) anode and preferential oxidises instead of the iron.
 The recent measurement has no practical implications for communication. Neutrinos make inefficient signals because they are almost indetectable. One application I've seen proposed is for messaging submarines, because radio can't penetrate and sound is slow.
 Radar Tech here. The best way I can explain it is that tracking missles have their own radar detection methods. They have to emit a radar signal to track their target, and that signal can be detected by an aircraft electronic counter measures (ECM). Of course there are qualifying criteria that distinguish between missles and other aircraft, and weapons manufacturers try to exploit those criteria to help make their missles less likely to be detected. Alternatively, ECM designers try to tighten up the gaps in detection to cover a wider range of radar signals.
 The electricity produced by a simple turbine generator comes in the form of a sinusoid. Given that nearly all power is produced by turbine generators, we need to be able to deal with them well just from a purely practical standpoint. Sinusoids also form a linear orthogonal basis on the space of periodic functions. This means that any periodic electrical signal, no matter how wacky or weird the shape, can be represented exactly by an infinite sum of sinusoids (a Fourier series). A square wave with period L, for example, isΣ (4/[2n+1)π) \* sin(2[2n+1]πx/L)And we can just truncate the series at n=some number depending on how accurately we want this sum to reflect an actual square wave. So, if we're good at dealing with sinusoids, dealing with a square wave is just solving a bunch of separate sinusoid problems and adding everything up. We can apply the same logic to aperiodic signals by pretending that they're periodic with period L- > inf. The sum term becomes an integral, and we're dealing with a Fourier transform instead of a Fourier series, but it's the same basic idea. Take some signal, turn it into a continuous superposition of sinusoids (which is the frequency-space representation obtained by the Fourier transform), and go to town. The question then is why sinusoids are so much nicer to work with than, say, a square wave, and it's because sinusoids solve differential equations of the general formjf(x) = df/dxwhere j is the imaginary number and denotes a phase factor (usually the imaginary number is i, but electrical engineers use i for current so j is used instead). Passing a sinusoid through an inductive (V ∝ di/dt) or capacitive (i ∝ dV/dt) circuit thus alters the signal only by a phase factor and a multiplicative constant, and a mix of inductive and capacitive elements will just make the phase somewhere in between purely inductive or capacitive. Signals which don't satisfy jf(x)=df/dx - ie anything that isn't a complex sinusoid - are irrevocably altered by passing them through a linear circuit, they don't come out the same just with a different phase and amplitude. They can't, since they don't satisfy jf(x)=df/dx.
 No, at least not instantly. As you move, you displace the atoms around you, which bump into the atoms around them and so on. This isn't immediate, the pulse travels at the speed of sound. And this "pulse" gets weaker as it goes on, until its much much weaker than the normal jiggling about of atoms due to temperature. So it's not instantaneous, and it doesn't go forever.
 When speeds get appreciably close to the speed of light, they don't add linearly, they obey [a more complicated formula](_URL_0_) which only looks like usual linear velocity addition when speeds are much slower than the speed of light. In this case, each ship would see the other moving at [2*80%/(1+80%^2 ) = 97.6%](_URL_1_) of the speed of light.
 An observer in free-fall is traveling (locally) inertially, so yes and yes.
 There is a [paper](_URL_0_) using machine learning classification techniques on fMRI data, and they were able to distinguish the 6 basic emotions (disgust, fear, happiness,sadness, anger and surprise), based on neural activation patterns in several midline cortical regions. Therefore, it does seem like there are different neural signatures for the different emotions that can be derived from fMRI data. That said, application to animals could be harder. Firstly, there are controversies regarding the universality of emotions, and it is unclear if we can actually generalize human emotions to animals. Secondly, to utilize a similar technique used in the paper, we would need some form of 'label' to indicate (or induce) what emotion a specific brain state corresponds to. As the animal would not be able to provide some form of subjective report, this could also be a challenge.
 I don't 100% know the answer to your question, but I thought this huge post deserves an answer after 12 hours, so I will type one. Speaking as a mathematician, the gamma function is essentially *the* canonical generalization of the factorial function to reals. As you say, it's not unique, nor can it be (interpolation never is). The [Bohr-Mollerup](_URL_0_) theorem lends some credence to this claim, since any other factorial interpolating function that is not the gamma function must fail some other desirable property. 1. It cannot be logarithmically convex. You would expect a generalization of the factorial function to be logarithmically convex, since the factorial is superexponential (so its logarithm is polynomial, and thus convex. )^(1) Or...2. It cannot satisfy the *f*(*x*+1) = *xf*(*x*) condition for *all* *x*  >  0. Of course, it must satisfy it for integers, because otherwise it cannot interpolate the factorial in the first place. But it's a natural requirement that it must be satisfiable also for *all* positive reals, so that you can say e.g. *f*(1.5) = 1.5 × *f*(0.5). Of course that doesn't mean the gamma function is the canonical choice for fractional derivatives. On the other hand, we have a number of other ways to define fractional derivatives (Fourier transform is my favourite, when it works), so we can actually check these things. The gamma function fits other definitions, so it is right. You will find that in every case you need a generalization of the factorial to reals, I daresay practically without any exceptions whatsoever, the gamma function is the correct choice. >  we can look up the value of Γ(0.5) and see that it's the square root of πYes, but keep in mind that the gamma function is offset from the factorial by one. So Γ(*n*) = (*n*–1)!, which means you actually want Γ(1.5) here. ^(1) Some details involving ignoring negative numbers is being skipped here.
 I think this may depend on whether the spherical object has friction or not. Even the smoothes surfaces can have some friction. And if that's the case it may be hard to answer definitively because… >  [Friction is not itself a fundamental force but arises from fundamental electromagnetic forces between the charged particles constituting the two contacting surfaces. **The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from first principles impossible and necessitates the use of empirical methods** for analysis and the development of theory. ](_URL_0_)If predicting friction is that difficult, I assume predicting friction-related sounds is similarly difficult. While I can hypothesize no noise would be made, it's hard to know for sure.
 > Common sense tells me that getting hit by a 3,000 pound car that is decelerating would still suck balls. Yet the outcome of the formula would be something negative. This is a misinterpretation of here of what force means. You seem to be interpreting it as *this is the force that the object would apply to you if it hit you*. The correct interpretation here is *this is the net force that is currently acting on the object*.
 It has to do with something called the blood-gas coefficient. That is to say, how much of the anesthetic is dissolved in the blood and how much is in a gaseous form just in contact with the blood. Anesthetic dissolved in blood is bound to proteins which inhibits the anesthetic from crossing the blood-brain barrier and having its effects (we still don't have a good idea how these work either). So anesthetics with low blood-gas coefficients have a quicker onset (induction) because more of the anesthetic is in gas form rather than dissolved.
 The average human body experiences the death of 50 to 70 billion cells per day. Using the estimation of a cell's weight at 27 picograms^[1](_URL_0_), we can estimate weight loss due to cell death as somewhere between 1.5 and 1.9g per day. However, as these cells are constantly being replenished as they die, the difference in weight is basically non-existant, being less than a quarter the weight of the air in your lungs. As for non-dead cells being shed, such as skin cells or epithelial cells lining your stomach, I'm not sure I can get an exact estimate. I recall being told that you shed roughly 10g of skin per day, but this changes a lot depending on physical activity performed, body size, air temperature etc.
 If the cut is superficial and doesn’t cause substantial scarring then your fingerprint will grow back. You probably already know that the skin is made up of the dermis and epidermis and that the epidermis itself is also layered. The reason superficial cuts don’t get rid of your finger print is because it is caused by features which lie deep below the surface, at the boundary of the dermis and epidermis. Basically the cells in this area have a wavy arrangement instead of being arranged all in a line. On the surface this wavy arrangement causes some parts of the skin to stick out more than others which creates a distinct pattern on the skin surface that we call a finger print. In order for damage to be so severe that the finger print is destroyed you have to cause damage to this wavy layer of cells deep (relatively) under the skins surface. Obviously this doesn’t take into account scarring which can also disrupt the finger print but doesn’t need damage to be that deep.
 A lot is [denatured](_URL_0_) - the longer and hotter the food is cooked, the more breaks down. In terms of consumption, this has to be balanced with the fact that cellulose is indigestible, and cooking breaks open the cell walls, allow access to nutrients in the first place. Consequently, the optimal cooking method for water soluble nutrient bioavailability is a brief microwaving. Even steaming doesn't do as good a job, because cooking the inside sufficiently means overcooking the outside.
 No, you cannot escape the inevitable conversion to heat. The difference in temperature of the room once the system has reached steady state will be negligible^1 . They have different heat capacities though so the initial temperature rises will differ.^2The temperature change of the objects themselves will be different due to differences in surface area–imagine how hot a small resistor would get dissipating 100W (it would glow/melt) compared to a person's body temperature. ^1 a trivial amount more of the monitor's EM radiation will exit the system if you have windows, because glass is opaque to the radiation given out by the space heater (almost completely infrared). edit:^2 the initial temperature changes depend on the heat transfer properties of the object too (just as for cool down)
 There's always an electrical field in the direction 90 degrees off from a magnetic field. The relationship between magnetic field and current is B = ( u * i ) / ( 2 * pi * r). B is the magnetic field, r is the distance from the current of where the measurement of the B field is taken. u is the permeability of free space which comes out to be 4pi * 10^-7 tesla * meter / ampere. So you can see that u is how much magnetic flux measured in "tesla" is produced across a certain distance in "meters" per "ampere" of current. So the permeability of steel would be a lot higher seeing how a magnetic field travels farther in steel than in air. So like most other laws of physics this can be flipped backwards and a changing magnetic field can also induce a current. It's how we can use electric current in a magnetic field to spin a motor or how we can spin a magnet to generate an electric current (i.e. turbines in a power plant)So that's how it works, but as far as "why" it works, no one in the world can explain that one. All we know is that in every experiment we've ever performed, when we observe a moving current, there will always be a magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the current, and when we change a magnetic field, we can induce a current in a direction perpendicular to the plane the magnetic poles are facing. Why is the universe made like that???? I can't help you there, you might just have to ask god on that one.
 Uranium oxide is a ceramic, like aluminum oxide. This is the same process as firing clay type ceramics such as pottery. It causes the individual ceramic particles to fuse or weld together at pounts where they contact each other. This can take place even at temperatures  below the melting point of UO2. This type of process can be seen in a large bag of ice from a grocery store, for example.
 Yes, they have brains. While insects do not have a heart or blood vessels per se, they do possess a valved dorsal vessel that pumps "blood" (i.e. hemolymoph) to the head, from where it circulates into the rest of the body.
 Or a different question. Drugs are reactive molecules. They will undergo chemical eractions and spontaneously change. Atmospheric oxygen is fairly reactive so air exposure often hastens this process. many expiration dates are referencing the sterility of the products.
 Yes, they work very well together! Thermodynamics is actually more "rigorously" defined when invoking quantum mechanics: You automatically get a minimal volume of phase space which gives the third law of TD. In fact, when studying physics, typically electrodynamics (which includes relativity) and quantummechanics are taught before statistical mechanics (which includes thermodynamics) for exactly this reason.
 I don't think you understand just how many combinations you can make. Say you have cd-key of 20 characters, which is pretty standard. You then have 20^36 possibilities = 7 *10^46. That is a 7 followed by 46 zeroes. ~~That number is so big it is hard to find something to compare it too, but if everybody in the world spend the next few million years entering CD-keys we would still have a negligible chance to get the same key twice.~~Edit: Example fail because of birthday paradox as DevestatingAttack point out. The chance of a collision (same key twice) is a much larger than you might assume. Silly, cause I had a course on this less then 6 months ago and still fell into the trap.
 This is an exceptionally difficult question to answer. It relies on knowledge of neuroscience, mathematics and philosophy, and I'm not possibly going to do it justice. First you need to define what information is. Unless you've read about it before, this is something that will hurt your head. Initially obvious, but then, the more you think about it, the harder it is to define. First, let me try to convince you that probability is intimately related to information. Let's say we're flipping a coin, and you really want to know the outcome, because you get sexual thrill from finding out coin toss outcomes. Now someone comes up to you and says "The last time NeuroBill's flipped a coin, it came up heads". Is that worth anything to you? No, because coins are fair, so it doesn't help you guess what the next coin toss will be. So did they given you any information at all? No. But what if you knew I was dirty, and I used a trick coin that always came up one way? Now when you get told the outcome of my previous coin toss, you know exactly what the outcome of my second coin toss will be, and hence you get no trill from the outcome, because seeing the coin flip gave you no new information. *If the outcome is certain, them knowledge of that outcome contains no information*Now what if, directly after the first person came and told you what my last coin toss outcome was, someone else came up and told you the exact same thing? The same words, but this time no new information. *Redundancy hurts information content. *In a neural context, we need to think about this a little differently, but what I said above will make sense. Let's remember, neurons fire trains of action potentials. That is their language. Now, if a neuron fires 10 times a second, what is the information content of that? Well, it depends. If the neurons fires perfectly, ever 100ms, their is almost no information in that. Why, because we already know for certain what it is going to do. Each additional spike gives us no further information than we didn't already know, because we already knew that neuron was going to fire every 100ms (Information depends on probability). However, if the exact timing varied depending on some input, then a spike train that might contain the exact same number of action potentials could contain vastly different amounts of information. Indeed, by looking at the probability of certain spiking patterns coming about, we can estimate the information content of the spike train. It appears as if most spike trains vary between about 4 and 400 bits per second (averaging very close to 1.5 bits per action potential). If we were to take the very dangerous assumption that we could scale this up, the human optic nerves contain around 2 million axons, at say, 10 bits/s is 20 million bits per second in the visual stream. However, as I said, this is a very dangerous assumption, because what about information redundancy? This is highly possible in the neural system, as neurons nearly always receive input from other neurons that appear to code for identical stimuli. That is to say, different neurons coding for the same thing often fire in related patterns, meaning when considered together, the information content of both neurons is less than the sum of each neuron independently. Thus, we can see 20 Mbit/s is the upper end for the information transfer rate of the optic nerve. It seems reasonable that each other sense contains a similar ORDER OF MAGNITUDE information rate, so we might say the upper bound for touch + olfaction/gustation + hearing + sight = ~ 80 MBit/s. But the exact redundancy between axons is less clear, and that could easily half, or 10th that number. If you want to know more, have a look at [Information Theory](_URL_0_).
 Not really - these responses are typically stimulated by the autonomic nervous system, so named because we don't have any conscious control of it. The body isn't wired like that. The ANS is crucial, because sometimes the body doesn't trust us to control crucial things, like temperature regulation. Breathing is an interesting case, as we have both conscious control of it, and an autonomic system to take over when we don't really feel like it. (See *being in a coma*)However, most responses, like the erector pili muscles that pull up our skin hair, don't have the intricate nervous system required for somatic (brain cortex -- >  effector nerve) control. It'd be a waste evolutionarily, for one. *Most autonomic responses don't bother asking our cerebral brain-bits for permission, communicating instead with our spine or brainstem, and they're so valuable for this, as it gives them a speed and priority that bypasses our brain's obsession with "thinking about things..."* There's one caveat here. There are people who in some ways, seem to have "control" over certain aspects of their autonomic nervous system. This is most likely due to them being able to exercise some control over the very stimuli that cause these automatic responses to trigger. *For example, I've met someone who could flush their cheeks on demand, but he described it as really just being able to embarrass himself on demand! *
 The landforms are mostly [kettles](_URL_0_), which are the remnants of melted glaciers/ice sheet left over from when much of Siberia was covered with an ice sheet during the last glacial maximum. Some of them may also be related to the rapid melting of permafrost, for example [theromkarst lakes](_URL_4_). The industry is totally independent of the lakes (save that they may have build pads near the lakes for easy access to water). All of the spots you flagged are in the [West Siberian Oil  &  Gas Basin](_URL_2_), which is a [massive petroleum basin](_URL_1_), so these pads are almost certainly related to oil and gas extraction (also pretty much looks like oil and gas fields in satellite imagery from anywhere, for example, compare a [spot in Texas](_URL_3_)).
 The remaining option is that the material which did deliver water and rock to the Earth came from locally available debris. Comets like 67P are not local to our region of the solar system and it's not a complete surprise that its heavy water ratio is different as the ratio has been observed to vary with [families of different objects. ](_URL_1_)Here's an excellent post overviewing how water was deposited on the Earth:  _URL_0_
 This is really a question of chemistry, and very reasonable to simulate with differential equations. The receptor binding rate is based on the number of total receptors relative to the amount of free testosterone, but I think what you're getting at is that there is a rate constant that pops out of this, independent of the amount of free testosterone. That is going to be determined by the strength of the chemical bond between the receptor and the testosterone, relative to the energy of the testosterone being "free" in solution. Unfortunately, unless you change the chemical structure of either one, you aren't going to get a fundamental change in the equations that govern the binding.
 The interjection for pain 'Ow' is different in every language... In french for example, it is 'aïe' (pronounced aye), in german it's 'auweh' (ow-ve) ...That said, I don't think you can really 'teach' something like this, because like most of spoken language it is picked up by babies and kids when they listen to their environment and people around them. If you want your kid to say 'Apple' when hurt, you probably need to isolate him in an environment where everyone else does the same ...
 It is about 2100 km from Sydney to Christchurch. 6 days = 144 hours, so the shark would have to travel 14.6 km/h to make the trek...a reasonable clip with a steady wind. Also, the manufacturer claims the balloon can hold its helium for 2 weeks, so leakage is not an issue. So it is *possible*, but pretty unlikely this was your shark. BTW, I got one of these for my niece, excellent gift.
 They're correct. From what I remember being told, RNA is so damn unstable and prone to thawing out accidentally that shoving it in the -80 essentially decreases the chances of it getting to that unstable temperature point and catalyzing its own degradation. Again, this is recall from ~3rd year, but we keep our in situ probes in the -80 as well, and so does everyone else I know.
 We don't know for certain. The leading explanation is that supermassive black holes are simply the result of hierarchical mergers of stellar-mass black holes which were formed by the massive Population-III stars in the early universe. Such stars would have been hundreds of solar masses (but nowhere close to the millions or billions of solar masses that SMBHs can boast), would have lived and died in a few million years, and then left behind a black hole of dozens of solar masses or perhaps more. One difficulty with this explanation is that once formed, the black holes would have to grow in mass very quickly in order to match our observations of supermassive black holes at high redshift. Even in the relatively early universe, there were black holes of billions of solar masses. Black holes can grow either by accreting matter or by merging with each other, and our models for black hole growth suggest that they should take significantly longer to reach supermassive size. Another idea is that they may have been primordial black holes which were formed in the extremely early universe, long before any stars began coalescing. This is not especially favored because our best cosmological modeling based on observations of the Big Bang has a rather hard time coming up with a way for that to happen. There are also hypotheses about quasi-stars, objects which coalesce in the early universe before any stars, wherein thousands of solar masses of material might collect together and then rapidly collapse into a black hole, rapidly creating an intermediate-mass black hole.
 _URL_0_ >  You keep giving blood until a person reaches some sort of stable blood pressure and oxygen saturation. We don't measure (except as a gross estimate) exactly how much blood a person loses due to hemorrhage and then just give enough to replace that amount. We assess the whole patient's hemodynamic status. What is their blood pressure? What is their urine output per hour (renal perfusion being a general indicator of hemodynamic status), What is their level of consciousness, What is their hemoglobin and hematocrit readings (level of red blood cells in the body), What is their oxygen saturation (how much oxygen are they absorbing into the blood stream), What is their cardiac output (stroke volume with each cardiac cycle)? You need minimally a mean arterial pressure of 70 mm Hg to perfuse the brain and prevent damage to higher cortical functions. If they are not maintaining a stable optimal blood pressure there may be other reasons other than hemorrhagic loss (like damage to the heart, liver or brain stem). >  I have given no blood to trauma patients, and I have transfused as many as 23 units into a single patient who was hemorrhaging extensively (and who ultimately died) in a short time ( <  3 hrs). So we look at the whole patient and their functional metabolic status to decide how much blood, if any, to give. Generally if their hemoglobin is  < 10 gm/dL we will consider transfusion if the patient is unstable. We will definitely transfuse if the hemoglobin is  <  7 gm/dL. >  Source(s): RN
 It has a probability 1 to happen eventually, yes. It's a common misconception that this means it's certain to happen (see [almost surely](_URL_0_)), but the distinction is academic and for all practical purposes you can consider it to be guaranteed.
 There's a pretty good summary [here](_URL_0_). What I took away from that was that it'd be insanely hard to pinpoint an exact starting location since planes aren't really Lagrangian drifters and ocean flow is more turbulent than it is laminar. What say you, /u/sverdrupian?
 Gravity is weak when energies are small relative to the Planck scale. So, gravity has been negligible in elementary particle interactions ever since the Universe's ambient energy was significantly less than the Planck scale, in other words since the Universe was a few Planck times old.
 The Mariana trench is about 11,000 meters below sea level. If you built a cofferdam down to that depth, as u/SirHerald suggests, the pressure would be about 3.2 atm. Divers experience a similar pressure at a depth of around 22 meters, so humans can survive these pressures in the short term. In the long term, I found [this chart](_URL_1_) from NASA suggesting you would have to worry about mild [nitrogen narcosis](_URL_0_), making you feel slightly drunk, and mild [oxygen toxicity](_URL_2_). So you probably wouldn't want to live at that pressure, but a short trip down wouldn't be any worse than diving. But, your question was about draining the oceans. The oceans cover 72% of the surface of the earth, and the average depth of the ocean is about 3700 meters. That means a large portion of the atmosphere will sink into the ocean, resetting 1 atm of pressure to a depth of something like 2600 meters below sea level. So that would make the Mariana trench a bit more tolerable at around 2.5 atm, but it would also mean some high altitude cities would become nearly uninhabitable. **edit** Fixed the bracket on the link. Wish I had caught it before I left this morning - wasn't expecting this to blow up so much.

 Ooh, sounds like a cool project! As for the terminology, you could use ["**endosymbionts**"](_URL_3_) - 'endo' meaning 'within', and 'symbiont' meaning 'living together'. Strictly speaking, endosymbionts really refers also to a whole host of other full-blown single-celled critters that live within the other living cells, so to differentiate you could use 'organelle endosymbionts' or something. With respect to their origin, mitochondria derive from early prokaryote bacteria, with modern [*Rickettsia*](_URL_2_) bacteria likely being their closest living relatives. *Rickettsia* are intracellular parasites, whose life cycle revolves around infecting and living within eukaryotic cells. Their genomes are very similar to those of mitochondria, lacking many of the genes required to synthesise and utilise many of the amino acids and precursor nucleotides they need to grow and reproduce - thus relying on the host genome to provide 'em, much like mitochondria (also quite superficially similar to how a virus works, really). Chloroplasts on the other hand derive from early photosynthetic cyanobacteria, also known as 'blue-green algae'. For a long time we weren't sure whether all chloroplasts descended from a single endosymbiotic event (known as 'symbiogenesis') as with mitochondria, or multiple independent ones, but it would appear (with [one curious exception](_URL_0_)), it is the case all modern chloroplasts are monophyletic - in other words, they're all related, and descended from something that's thought to be a bit like the modern cyanobacteria [*Gloeomargarita lithophora*](_URL_1_). So in short, mitochondria are basically stripped-down bacteria, and chloroplasts likewise were originally bacteria, albeit photosynthetic ones.
 I was not aware that muscles underwent such a process, let alone the brain. It does depend what you mean by 'glucose efficiency'. In muscles:Energy deprivation will increase the rate of protein degradation, weakening the overall strength of the muscle and increasing the likelihood of injury. In mice: _URL_1_This effect may improve efficiency if only the muscle fibers in the best condition are kept working - but even then it wouldn't be useful for any kind of training exercise. Fasting will improve glucose uptake by the cell by increasing sensitization to glucose (kind of like the opposite effect of type 2 diabetes), but not necessarily glucose metabolism. This paper addresses about the pathway involved:_URL_0_I know that oxygen deprivation training does increase the capacity of oxygen carriers in the blood, which is a factor in glucose efficiency - but this is not by virtue of a change in the muscle. Rather, this is via increased production of haemoglobin in the blood. This effect would also aid the brain.
 Placing a chicken bone in vinegar for 2-3 days is a classic elementary/middle-school science demonstration; overtime, the acetic acid slowly strips the calcium from the bone leaving behind only the elastin and collagen fibers. At this point you can easily bend the bone (within reason) without breaking it. Once bent, I suppose you could fix the bone back into place if you had a way to add calcium back into the elastin scaffold. This isn't as simple as placing the bone in a calcium solution, since the mineralization process in-vivo is largely driven by glandular secretions, vitamin-D, and other processes that could be hard to reproduce outside the body.
 The energy is lost. Energy isn't conserved in an expanding Universe.
 There is an incredible amount of regulation on your DNA, mostly from epigenetics which silences a good portion of your genome. During development, we are expressing way different genes than we do now. Even the different types of cells you have now express way different genes than each other. They all have the same DNA, it's just a matter of what genes are accessible and expressed. Development also requires complex signaling pathways that sense the cellular environment and cause growth to/away from certain things. If you lose a limb, your body doesn't want to regrow it...it basically causes inflammation and scarring processes to close the wound and prevent infection. You'd have to somehow tell your body to not close the wound and instead tell it to re-grow everything. There is a ton of research into this, but a large problem is that it's incredibly difficult to tell skin cells AND blood vessels AND bone and other connective tissue to all just magically re-grow and work together like before. The way these all formed during development was through a complex series of interactions, something very difficult to re-create in an adult.
 Sunburn is caused by exposure to Ultraviolet radiation. (Ultraviolet is just a big higher energy/shorter wavelength than visible light). There is significant variation in UV flux at Earth that correlates with the solar cycle, with the flux increasing towards solar maximum (more solar activity). I don't know whether this variation is significant enough to cause a marked increase in how quickly we get sunburn, but I would assume so, as the effects of the variation have noticeable effects in the atmosphere. edit:The increase in UV flux **is** appreciable at the surface of the Earth, but I'm uncertain of the exact magnitude of the change, which is why I'm unsure whether it is significant enough to effect sunburn. edit: I was told that the increase in UV flux is on the order of 4% on the Earth's surface...this is on the order of the differences that occur from traveling to different latitudes, so the effect is far from overwhelming.
 This would take very long time to full review, and I urge you to do your own research. I think an okay summation is that basically it is a bit like salt and high blood pressure: How much a high cholesterol diet leads to high blood cholesterol is debatable, and certainly involves interaction with other elements of the diet (sugar, fat), general health, body composition and genetics. However, reducing dietary cholesterol can reduce plasma cholesterol modestly, around 10%  (1. 2). There can however, be no argument whatsoever that diet in a significant component to the cause of high cholesterol (3)1. Tang JL, Armitage JM, Lancaster T, Silagy CA, Fowler GH, Neil HA (1998).

 Yes. This is called a [non-reversing mirror](_URL_0_). There were some articles about a new kind of such mirror invented a few years ago. The guy who did it also made a side view mirror with "no blind spot".
 This question is really too personal to answer well. There are many many factors that can result in a temporary reduction in sleepiness. Light has a direct alerting effect. Timing of meals and/or caffeine intake will also affect your sleepiness profile. If we consider the case where all other factors are ostensibly controlled for then there are still a couple of plausible reasons, outlined below. **Local sleep**Typically people think of sleep and wake as whole brain states. However, [recent research](_URL_6_) shows that parts of the brain can be locally "asleep" or "awake" when the rest of the brain is awake or asleep, respectively. Local sleep is use-dependent. In other words, brain regions become fatigued from overuse. Constant stimulation of one hand during the day leads to [more intense slow wave sleep in the corresponding region of the somatosensory cortex](_URL_1_). Conversely, if your arm is immobilized for a day, [the corresponding region of the somatosensory cortex has less intense slow wave sleep](_URL_4_). During local sleep, there appears to be [metabolic recovery](_URL_5_) in these regions. It is therefore plausible that we are able to temporarily rest overworked brain regions by tuning them out when we are otherwise awake. That is still a hypothesis, but it is gaining increasing support. **Circadian rhythms**There are two processes that principally regulate sleep: the [sleep homeostatic process](_URL_3_) and the [circadian process](_URL_2_). The homeostatic process is the name we give to the empirical observation that people become increasingly tired the longer they are awake and less tired the longer they are asleep. It is now thought to be due to the accumulation of certain sleep-promoting substances in the brain. These same substances are thought to induce local sleep. The circadian process is due to your body's endogenous circadian clock, which promotes wakefulness during the day and sleep at night. Together, these two processes act in a complementary fashion. Homeostatic sleep pressure is continually increasing across the day. To balance this, the circadian drive for wakefulness also increases across the day, [reaching its peak only a few hours before bedtime](_URL_0_). This may seem an odd time to have your strongest circadian drive for wakefulness, but it is necessary to fight against the increasing sleep pressure to maintain our long 16-h bout of wakefulness. Consequently, there is a window of time, called the *forbidden zone*, within which it is very difficult to initiate sleep and where the circadian drive for wakefulness is very strong. For most people, this occurs around the time you are talking about: ~8pm.
 Depends how large the fish is, how deep the tank, how carbonated (assuming soda pop), and if the water source is being constantly carbonated or just initially carbonated. The pCO2 in the air is very low relative to oxygen and even lower compared to nitrogen (which is the main constituent of air) so the great proportion of CO2 in the water will naturally want to get into the air to return to equilibrium (this is why your soda bubbles after you open it and eventually becomes flat). If you're talking about a modestly large and healthy fish like a salmon that was put in a 30 gallon tank of club soda, the fish might have short term acid/base changes in its blood but will be fine as the water body will reach equilibrium quickly. CO2 gas is poorly soluble in water and is converted into carbonic acid (google Henderson Hasselbalch equilibrium), so in the initial time of exposure the fish will have an increased respiratory acidosis but should be capable of compensating that by metabolizing the carbonic acid into bicarbonate. The fish will also likely undergo some stress due to buoyancy issues from the saturated CO2 gas in the water that is rapidly escaping into the air. Use a small fish with a same setup and its fate may be more grim. Use the large fish but in a really deep tank and at low depths, then the outcome might not be so good--but the fish will likely stress out and move to safer (shallower depths). The effects of Henry's law, where increased pressure will lead to a greater concentration of the gas, which in regards to the fish will cause it to absorb more CO2, will make the minor acid/base issue in the first example more significant. It's ability to ventilate (get rid of CO2 formed from its own metabolic and physical activity will be harder and it will undergo more anaerobic metabolism than it would have due to this process and the less abundant total O2 gas available (per Dalton's law of partial pressures). TL:DR In a class room setting of a small tank a couple liters of club soda, a decent sized and healthy fish will not straight up suffocate. In other circumstances, it will face metabolic acid/base challenges.
 [Figure for reference. ](_URL_0_)The above figure is a model of a wind turbine, essentially the reverse of a fan. The "stream tube" going through that turbine plane encompasses the flow that goes through it, without any crossing the boundary of the tube. Much like a pipe, but with no walls and varying shape. In the wind turbine, it's extracting momentum from the flow, so the airspeed slows down. With approximately constant density, that means the streamtube behind the turbine gets wider as conservation of mass requires. A fan works in the same way, just in reverse: it accelerates the flow, adding momentum to it. So the streamtube in front of a fan is larger, and smaller downstream from it. Important to your question is that there is no instantaneous change in velocity across the fan, it's a gradual process along the length of the streamtube. Fluids really *hate* instantaneous changes in properties like velocity and pressure (which is a shockwave). So the question what's the change of speed across a fan, it's what is the *rate of change* of speed across a fan. And that's going to depend on the local conditions, the fan, and the power it's putting in.
 For starters, it depends on what kind of vaccine you are referring to. Newer vaccines have a large body of evidence behind them including RCTs. You can find systematic reviews that synthesize controlled evidence for all of the most recent vaccines. Vaccines that have been around for decades are primarily evidenced by massive amounts of epidemiological data, although we also have plenty of laboratory based data as well. Because vaccines were introduced in different places at different times and because vaccines have been given to massive numbers of people  (allowing for tremendous sample sizes for analysis), we have been able to analyze this epidemiological data in just about every way you can imagine. In the case of vaccines that are known to be efficacious, the data is uncontroversially strong.
 Your left hand is structurally distinct from your right hand. In other words, there's no orientation, rotation or any translation that will turn your right hand into your left hand. What this means is there's absolutely no way to put your left hand in a right handed glove and vice-versa (have a go). This chirality, as its termed, works in the exact same way for molecules. For example, 'left handed' molecules can't fit into 'right handed' enzymes. An enzyme would be right handed because it's made up of smaller right handed molecules. I just to make sure that it's understood that not all objects can be left or right handed. Just because it has a mirror image it doesn't mean the mirror image is the other hand. For example, imagine you put a mirror next to a coffee cup and then removed the mirror but kept the reflection there as a real object. You could translate one of the cups into the other and they would perfectly match - they are the exact object. And that's the key. Left and right handed objects/ molecules are structurally distinct objects/ molecules.
 The difficulty in creating such a state is that a fluid, like a liquid or gas, behaves very differently from a solid, and so there's no way to be both solid and liquid at the same time. And for the record, gelatin is a solid. There is, however, a point where water is neither liquid nor gas (steam), but something called a supercritical fluid, where the distinctions between gas and liquid break down. [Here's a video of CO2 going supercritical](_URL_0_).
 This is not a hard fast rule of course, but it is true that in most weather regimes, clouds all seem to "hang" around the same height. The key to understanding this is realizing that clouds are not "objects" like lakes or mountains or lego bricks; they are just "blobs" of air that have cooled to the point where water vapor can condense into cloud droplets. There's nothing really holding them together, it's just a bunch of air that happens to be hanging around in the same place. If you got a strong enough fan running, you could definitely "blow" a cloud apart (though we're talking one huge fan here) under the right circumstances. For your typical cumulus cloud ([like these](_URL_4_)), the process of cloud formation starts when a pocket of air near the ground is warmed by the sun. Eventually, this "bubble" of air warms up to the point where it is less dense than the air around it, and begins to rise as an updraft. As this air rises, it cools due to expansion (known as [adiabatic cooling](_URL_0_)). If the conditions are right, eventually it cools to the point where the water vapor in the air begins to condense into cloud droplets, and a new cloud is born. This cooling due to expansion happens at a constant rate (known as the [adiabatic lapse rate](_URL_3_)), so air which starts at the same temperature and humidity is going to start condensing at the same height. Since the temperature and humidity near the ground don't change a lot with horizontal distance (under most circumstances, temperatures only vary by a few degrees over hundreds of miles or kilometers), the clouds which form from this process all end up starting at roughly the same height. You can actually see a pretty cool consequence of this on the leading edge of many thunderstorms: where cooler, moist air from the storm meets warmer, drier air from in front of the storm, you get what's know as a [shelf cloud](_URL_1_). The cloud heights in the cooler, wetter air mass are much lower than the cloud heights in the warmer, drier air mass ahead of the storm, [leading to the appearance of a "shelf" of cloud dropping down from the storm](_URL_2_). This is a pretty simplified picture, but in general it describes the process by which clouds form in most weather regimes. Let me know if you have any questions!
 Yes, but it's complicated. You can estimate the initial rotational period of a planet by looking at the total angular momentum of the region of the protoplanetary disk the planet forms from. However, day lengths are not constant and will generally decrease over time. Earth had a much shorter day length billions of years ago. Shortly after its formation, it rotated once every 7 hours. Over time, it gradually transferred much of its rotational energy into the moon through tidal interactions, resulting in the gradual increase of the length of a day to its current 24 hour value, the gradual increase of the lunar orbital radius, and the moon becoming [tidally locked](_URL_0_). You can also have some interesting and unexpected interactions when looking at how day lengths evolve. For example, there is some geological evidence from stromatolite fossils that suggests that the day length of the Earth stopped increasing and remained at a constant value of 21 hours for about a billion years during the Precambrian era before starting to increase again. The reason for this is somewhat of an open question, but [this paper](_URL_3_) attributes the start of this stabilizing effect to the length of day reaching a value (21 hours) that is resonant with the thermally-driven atmospheric tide, fully canceling the decelerating effect of the lunar tidal torque and maintaining a constant day length. It suggests with  computational simulations that the resonance was broken due to [snowball Earth events](_URL_2_) during the late Precambrian which coincide with the point where the day length began to increase again. According to these simulations, the history of the Earth's day length over time could look [like this](_URL_1_). I haven't seen any studies that look at how the Martian day length has evolved over time, but given the comparably negligible mass of its moons and tidal forces, it likely started with a day length much more similar to 24 hours than Earth's initial day length of 7 hours.
 "Fiber" is somewhat of a layman's term. It doesn't have any real scientific meaning especially considering how similar it is to the term "wire" There really isn't any real meaning although I would think that a "fiber" is more like a thread while a "wire would be thicker.
 I think it should be possible to do something like a Cochlear implant, but for smell instead of sound. The cochlear implant converts sound into electrical impulses which interface to the brain. Basically, we would replace or add an electronic nose. I think there has been a lot of research on that topic, but I'm not an expert.
 Struts *are* regenerative. They are springs, so for every time they hit a bump, they store energy and then return that energy coming down from the bump. They do it with a higher efficiency than an electrical system could, too. Spring efficiency is greatly effected by speed. When springs are compressed or stretched, they change temperature- the longer that heat has to dissipate into the air, the less efficient the spring is. Batteries become increasingly less efficient the faster they have to store energy, so the high speed movement in suspensions is better suited to springs. Braking happens over multiple seconds, but bumps take a very short time from start to finish. Shock absorbers are not regenerative. They limit the speed at which the strut can stretch or compress by dissipating excess energy into oil. They are basically a loose piston in viscous oil, and if they move too fast the oil slows them down, heating up in the process. However the shock only consumes a small amount of the energy in the bump- most of it is stored and returned by the spring. You could use a linear motor to [absorb the transient energy](_URL_0_), but again thats a problem because the transient will be *even faster* than the bump itself, because you're only absorbing the sudden jerk. You have to ask the batteries to absorb a lot of very sudden, very small, very frequent bursts of power, which is exactly all of the things that they *hate*. That kills efficiency, increases cost, and decreases the life of the batteries. Plus the only time the shocks every absorb significant energy is when the wheel is moving, not the car body. Bumps can't make the car body move fast enough to activate the shocks. Since the energy it takes to move the wheels is tiny compared to the mass of the car, the energy you can recover is also tiny. You'd need 4 powerful, heavy (relative to shocks) electric motors and complicated electronics to absorb a tiny part (bump vs slowing the entire car) of a tiny part (shock vs entire bump) of a tiny part (wheel movement vs car movement) of the energy that goes into moving a car.
 Technically, the mandibular fenestra is not exclusive to archosaurs. Many archosauriforms (more rootward than the crown-group) have antorbital and mandibular fenestrae as well - check it out on [*Proterosuchus*](_URL_0_). Overall, these fenestrae probably originated in the stem-lineage. If you're looking for other taxa with convergently acquired "additional fenestrae" relative to the ancestral state, it's been suggested that the synapsid *Varanops* *might* have a mandibular fenestra, but I don't think this still holds up. No others come to mind.
 Measurements of G are affected by a large uncertainty ultimately because gravity is very weak. You would think it would be fairly easy to extract an estimate of G from orbital dynamics. However, all gravitational effects from a body of mass M are proportional to the combination μ = MG, the standard gravitational parameter. The μ of a celestial body is very easy to determine once you can measure orbits around it (or, if you're lucky enough to be standing on it, the surface gravity), and indeed the μ of most solar system objects is known to great precision. However, to extract an estimate of G from μ you'd have to divide by M... and you don't know M. We do not have very precise independent estimates of the masses of planet and stars. The G extracted from this method has a relatively huge error. Thus G can only be measured through the gravitational effects of *prepared* bodies with well known masses, which need to be much smaller than planets. So you are now measuring extremely weak gravitational fields generated by man-made objects in [Cavendish](_URL_0_)-like experiments. This gives a more precise estimate of G, but still with an error comparably larger than all of the other fundamental constants simply because of how small the forces to be measured are, and how hard it is to shield from noise. Going back to the planets, G measured from Cavendish-style setups is the most precise determination, so you actually use *that* estimate to extract one for the masses of celestial bodies through M = μ/G. That's how you get the known figures for the masses of the Earth, Sun, etc. For contrast, hbar is known to definitely better precision because it can be determined directly through a variety of not-as-fragile experiments. An example (not necessarily the best) is a [Watt balance](_URL_1_).

 Speech and language disorders are referred to as [aphasia](_URL_2_), and two of the major types are called Broca's aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia, named after the neurologists that first described them. Paul Broca [famously wrote](_URL_1_) about a patient who could only utter the single syllable "tan", and just like Hodor, went by the nickname Tan. That's probably where Martin got the inspiration. Broca's ahasias can come in different forms. They're also referred to as *expressive* aphasias, meaning people with them have trouble producing speech in some way, but not with understanding language. You can watch [this video](_URL_3_) for an example. These types of aphasias can be very frustrating, since it can take tremendous effort to even say simple sentences. Conversely, Wernicke's aphasias are disorders in understanding language. You can see an example [here](_URL_0_). That patient seems to have no problem producing speech, but can't find the right words, so it comes out as gibberish.
 The doubling time for scientific publications is about 15 years. _URL_0_Figure: _URL_0_#Fig3There doesn't seem to be a noticeable jump after computers came into play, as it's always been exponential. Ray Kurzweil argues that advancements have been this way (even when you consider advancements in agriculture, language, etc.). The computer was a necessary tool to keep the advancement exponential. A better question would be to ask if the exponential factor itself is increasing or decreasing. EDIT: Oh, neat. You can see the decrease around 1920  &  1945 due to the World Wars.
 Both appear to be real effects. The "flash  &  burn", however, was at most local in its effects and seems to have been previously overestimated (See: [Belcher, C. M., Collinson, M. E., Sweet, A. R., Hildebrand, A. R.,  &  Scott, A. C. (2003). Fireball passes and nothing burns—The role of thermal radiation in the Cretaceous-Tertiary event: Evidence from the charcoal record of North America. Geology, 31(12), 1061-1064](_URL_1_)), while the "nuclear winter" phenomenon was global. So, in regards to your question, it seems the cooling was by far the most consequential phenomenon. But wait! There's more: 2 other important effects were more than a decade of acid rain and changes in the patterns of ocean currents  &  stratification. From [Pope, K. O., Baines, K. H., Ocampo, A. C.,  &  Ivanov, B. A. (1997). Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub Cretaceous/Tertiary impact. Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 102(E9), 21645-21664. ](_URL_0_):*"These sulfate aerosols caused a second pulse of acid rain that was global. Radiative transfer modeling of the aerosol clouds demonstrates (1) that if the initial rapid pulse of sulfate aerosols was global, photosynthesis may have been shut down for 6 months and (2) that for the second prolonged aerosol cloud, solar transmission dropped 80% by the end of first year and remained 50% below normal for 9 years. As a result, global average surface temperatures probably dropped between 5° and 31°K, suggesting that global near-freezing conditions may have been reached. Impact-generated CO2 caused less than 1°K greenhouse warming and therefore was insignificant compared to the sulfate cooling. The magnitude of sulfate cooling depends largely upon the rate of ocean mixing as surface waters cool, sink, and are replaced by upwelling of deep ocean water. This upwelling apparently drastically altered ocean stratification and circulation, which may explain the global collapse of the delta 13C gradient between surface and deep ocean waters at the K/T boundary. "*So, in retrospect, the main effects which make the Chixculub impact stand out are: * a decadal scale nuclear winter effect, comparable to several "years without a summer" in a row;* a global pulse of acid rain, yet again in excess of a decade;* changes in ocean circulation and stratification. The wildfires seem, in comparison, like an afterthought.
 [Research](_URL_1_) has shown that the gene for expressing red hair (MC1R) is correlated to the over-expression of certain genes containing HBA1 and regular beta-globin, which play a role in coding for pain receptors in the human body. Basically, redheads (as you may have heard before) require more anesthesia to be medically sedated, as well as having higher sensitivity to hot and cold temperature shifts, and pain in general. And also, there have been cases of humans that [have no pain receptors at all](_URL_0_) but can somehow still "feel" temperature shifts and pressure changes in the atmosphere. All in all, I think it's a combination of how your nerves react to stimuli and send the signal to your brain. Even though one might not be able to *feel* pain, that doesn't mean they can't die from bleeding out, for example. So in your case, even though some people have a better *tolerance* for some temperatures (how their receptors communicate to their brain), that fact does not change the way their physical body will respond. Internal body temperatures and sweat reactions to heat is also on a case-by-case basis.
 There are many ways in which artwork is photographed or scanned. The problem with flash photography is repeated exposure, such as a steady line of tourists in a museum. The main reason to use a flash is to increase the amount of light reflected off the object and into the camera. The other way to do this is to use a longer exposure time. This requires a tripod so that the camera does not move during the exposure. This is why many tourists in a museum would be using flash photography, since they are using a handheld camera. Photographing a painting in a studio would use proper lighting, lenses and exposure time to not require a flash.
 Was the pan well seasoned before the plastic melted onto it? If it has some amount of oils / fats in the iron , like a bbq plate it may not have entered the pores too far. When things get stuck to our pans we boil water in them to loosen and soften the crud and scrape off while the water boils.If you get most of it off cast iron is not that hard to clean mechanically and re-season as others suggest. Acetone may soften some plastics and allow easier removal of the bulk. Check the MSDS (material safety data sheet) sheet for precautions before using acetone.
 It depends on how reflective the EVA suit is. At Earth's distance from the Sun, each m^2 receives 1360 W of heat from the Sun. At 25 °C each m^2 emits 450 W of infrared. So if it absorbs all of incident sunlight, and add this to the 100 W generated by the human body, it will accumulate energy and warm up. That's why EVA suits are white - to reflect a good part sunlight and absorb just a small fraction so that they don't overheat. (They still have an evaporative cooling system to achieve more precise thermal control).
 Not sure of what you're trying to ask. Usually the post has it's data contained in a database, so when you delete it the database entry is wiped.
 Speaking from a mechanical perspective: Putting your phone on ice and then heating it up suddenly (or having a hot phone and then cooling it suddenly) will probably damage some internal components simply from the temperature shock. Given the risks of having hot things next to cold things, I honestly couldn't recommend actually trying this. The thing about batteries lasting longer when they're cold has more to do with when they are idle (and hence the thing where people put batteries in the freezer). Batteries slowly discharge when they are idle because of the migration of electrons and ions inside the battery, in the direction that we don't want them to travel because it means we don't get to extract useful energy. Keeping them cold slows down this process. This is ever so slightly outside of the literature I follow, but I think its worth noting. Battery design has significantly advanced in the past 30 years, and as far as I know this no longer actually does anything to improve battery life. There's even the risk that you damage the battery (especially nickle metal hydride  batteries).
 Basically they measure the blackbody radiation from an object (which is in the infrared range). They measure the infrared emissions from an object and using Wien's law. They are susceptible to reflections by other objects. If you put a cold object next to a hot pot some of the infrared radiation may reflect off the cold object and fool the thermometer. The thermometers also correct for ambient temperature. Links:_URL_2__URL_0__URL_1_
 A coil type inductor is typically modeled with a small series resistance (attributed to the resistance of the wire making up the coil) and a small parallel capacitance (attributed to "inter-winding capacitance", the effect of capacitance from one turn of the coil to the next). A ferrite bead is a bit trickier. They're actually meant to work by the action of a lossy magnetic material. Meaning, the changing magnetic field heats the ferrite, which takes real power from the electrical signal. Since it consumes real power, it can be modeled in the circuit as a resistance. But it's a frequency dependent resistance, very low in value at low frequencies, and rising at higher frequencies, up to some limit, then falling again at very high frequencies. Unfortunately I can't say much more about the underlying cause of this behavior. High-end vendors of PCB-level ferrite beads (Murata, Taiyo Yuden, ...) publish R(f) and L(f) graphs for each individual part number. I'm not sure what kind of documentation is available for the beads used on power cables.
 From a tap, it should be about the same. If you are pouring out a closed bottle with low pressure liquid then spiralling is going to be faster because the spiralling allows for smooth flow of air in and water out.
 His argument has nothing to do with GMO and is an argument against monoculture, which we already practice quite extensively. Monoculture is the practice of using a single variety of plant across wide areas. It is done to control exact features of the crop so they are all identical and require identical management and are harvested at the same time. Most Western world farmers plant monoculture fields already and are susceptible to the issues he listed above already whether those crops are GMO or not. We have even seen the worst case happen pre-GMO when [Gros Michel](_URL_0_) bananas were virtually wiped out by a fungus. > GMO crops have little to no diversity, sudden and unexpected changes can be catastrophic, whereas an organic crop will be relatively ok.GMO is not the opposite of organic. You can grow a GMO seed to harvestable crop organically. GMO describes how the genes arrived in the seed, by manipulation in a lab rather than by natural crossings. Organic is a method of growing crops using no artificial fertilizers or pesticides. Neither protect from the ravages he is worried about, only not planting monoculture crops would.
 The larger the diameter, the faster the signal. Alternatively, the better the insulation (myelination), the faster the propegation without having to increase the diameter.
 With a sufficient amount of energy, any EM radiation can damage a CD. Have you heard of sticking a CD in a microwave? Using less concentrated higher energy EM radiation, microwaves cook food for you.
 Crystallization in general occurs more easily in the presence of a seed crystal. Nucelation (starting a crystal) requires an expenditure of energy that is only recovered after the crystal has grown to a certain radius ([The green curve here](_URL_0_) of energy vs radius gives an idea of what this looks like) Crystal growing is virtually always done with seed crystals - it is 'easier' (less costly in terms of energy and therefore a more likely occurrence) to extend an existing crystal than to start a new one. Depending on how easily spontaneous nucleation occurs, the difference may not be easily measurable, but it does exist. Proton disorder in ice has no impact on this at all.
 Yes. See [this article on glaciers and uneven gravitational pull](_URL_0_) which talks about the mass of glaciers being so much, that they influence the surrounding water conditions to create uneven sea level rise.
 The article actually discusses the answer. It's a painfully slow process that is not ready to be used in manufacturing. They essentially focused a laser in as tiny an area as possible and altered the structure of the metal there. This was verified by electron microscopy (and the black dot itself may be too tiny to see with the naked eye). It takes half an hour to blacken a piece the size of your pinky according to the article. Compare this to the size of a useful photovoltaic panel.
 This is a very good question and addresses evolution in a broad sense, not just mimicry. A common misunderstanding about evolution is that intermediates are not effective, and from that misunderstanding people wonder how forms which we think of as "finished," your flower mantis for example, could come to exist at all. In order for a mutation to be beneficial, it only must be slightly so in order to become dominant over time. Say the original non-flowerlike, flower mantis ancestor developed some trait that made it and its offspring only slightly better at catching prey. Maybe the mantis hatched from its egg a white color instead of green and matched the petals of the flowers in its habitat. From there, any small change that made its descendants more like that flower would be a beneficial mutation. Since any mutation in this direction aids in fitness, even if only barely, over time the mantis species could evolve into what we see today. The key is to realize that new traits don't have to be far better than older ones. They only have to be a little better. If you want more details, I would recommend The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins.
 I decided to look around to see if there was any actual science on this. [This article](_URL_0_) in *Psychology Today* discusses a "gaze detection" mechanism (specialized brain cells that notice people looking at you), but that mechanism relies on them being in your field of vision (at least in your peripheral vision). Also, the article does not actually link to the scientific studies it is referencing, which is irritating. After some more looking, I managed to find the [Wikipedia article on the subject of the feeling of being stared at](_URL_2_), which referenced a [study in 1898](_URL_4_), published in *Science*, which found "invariably negative" results for people actually being able to tell if they were being stared at (people *believing* that they can tell when they are being stared at, however, is well documented, and is what caused him to undertake the study in the first place). A [further study in 1913](_URL_1_) (published in *The American Journal of Psychology*) produced a hit rate of 50.2%, i.e. an "astonishing approximation of pure chance". Both of them provide possible explanations for why people believe that they can tell if they are being stared at, despite the lack of demonstrated ability to do so. The primary person who believes that the effect actually exists appears to be [Rupert Sheldrake](_URL_3_). His theories of "morphic resonance" have generally been dismissed for lack of evidence.
 There is no distinction between a black hole formed from coalescing matter and one formed from coalescing antimatter. An incoming object -- whether matter or antimatter -- would increase the mass of the black hole.
 >  Or is there so little ambient x-ray light that we wouldn't see much of anything at all? Pretty much, yeah. OTOH, it could work if our planet revolved around a neutron star.
 This is possible. And moreover, it's possible in the way that DrBurrito said that it isn't. Acoustic vibrations can, and do, generate a steady flow in addition to the oscillations. For speeds you would need for this effect, you would need what's called "jet driven streaming." This occurs at a change in cross section for the acoustic flow. Imagine a big pipe, like an organ pipe. Acoustic vibrations are like alternating between sucking and blowing air from that pipe. When the pipe sucks in, the air outside is at rest, so it's happy to flow in evenly from all around the orifice. When the air come out, though, it has forward momentum, so the slug of air wants to continue forward. The net effect that you would see is that air sucks in from the sides of the opening, and blows out the middle as a very fast stream. Thus, if you wanted an effect like your picture, you would set up your speaker system as a bunch of tubes pointed at the listener. You would want a very high pressure to generate a strong enough wind (you'd deafen the listener), but it'd get the job done! There are other kinds of streaming as well, if you want to look [here](_URL_0_).
 Any! That's the point of relativity :PIf we're both moving at the same velocity, we'll both see time the same way. But if you're moving 100 kph away from me, I will see your clocks moving more slowly. *However*, from your perspective, *I* am moving 100 kph away from *you* - so you see *my* clocks moving more slowly.
 What a great question! I'm sure many animals hate flies, particularly the kind that take bites out of the animal. Some animals seem to know that flies carry disease as well. But whether any animals show the same disdain that we do upon even seeing a fly, I doubt it. As most animals are raised outdoors so they become acustomed to bugs flying about. Also their sense of personal space and boundaries are different so they don't see a fly as invading their home the way we do.
 If you're just talking about the initial burning sensation you get upon inhalation, it's mostly the particulate matter. It has both direct physical and chemical effects. If you touch the bronchial epithelium (the cells lining the airways), they release ATP. The particulate matter in cigarette/marijuana/etc smoke is sufficient to do this. ATP is best known as the energy currency of the cell, but outside the cell it has certain signaling characteristics. It gets broken down pretty quickly, but if it builds up it can hit nerve endings in the affected regions and give you that "burning" sensation. It's a pain response, just like any other pain response, warning you to stop doing whatever it is you're doing because you're causing damage. This response lasts seconds, usually, and often induces the coughing response. There are also more long-term inflammatory signals involved. When that particulate matter gets in contact with your epithelium, it can (and usually will) cause damage because it is chemically reactive. This damage will lead to an inflammatory response in the epithelium, which often involves eicosanoid biosynthesis. Some of these are responsible for medium-term length pain sensations; minutes, possibly hours. This is the same pathway you target when you use aspirin or other NSAIDs.
 We already GM crops to be more robust. It is possible to further modify them to grow elsewhere or in a wider variety of conditions,  but as for whether or not that would effect taste... It would depend on whether or not the genes that needed to be modified to make the plant more robust effected taste -- it would depend.
 Numbers follow a defined pattern that repeats after 10 items. You only have to remember 9 8 7 6.... Regardless of where you start, you know the next number down is one decrement from the previous, with a tens place to start. From fifty-seven you know the next is 56. Once you get to 50, all you need to know is that the next tens value down is forty and you know it’s 49. The alphabet doesn’t really work that way. What is the relationship between o and n? Or k and j? Or T and H? You have to memorize the entire string, rather than a simple pattern. It’s the same for when you first learned the alphabet. You memorized the order of letters. You just haven’t done that in reverse.
 Neutrons can be stored if they have low enough energy (these are called cold neutrons) but not for very long because they turn into protons after about 15 minutes. They do have applications though, there are facilities where neutrons are scattered through materials to see how they deflect and to study the material properties. These are typically built next to nuclear reactors, where there are lots of free neutrons.
 I'm not sure what your question is here. If we naively assume that the entire universe popped into existence, as is, 13.8 billion years ago, then we'd have travelled around the galaxy about 55 times. But that didn't happen. Things to time to cool down, coalesce, and form into the structures that we see today, so we haven't been around the galactic center 55 times yet. It's some number less than that.
 No only when you overexert yourself. From PZ's Pharyngula:[Why do muscles hurt after exercise? ](_URL_0_)
 In principle... I think so? Large nuclei do have "rotational modes", where there is some collective motion of the protons and neutrons. These rotational modes typically decay by emitting gamma rays and returning to lower energy levels, but maybe there is some small probability the nucleus could split instead. In general protons and neutrons behave about like electrons do: with orbitals and energy levels. These orbitals are just much smaller and the energy levels much higher than for electrons. It is possible though to have collective modes where multiple particles act together, such as with deformations, rotations, and vibrations. However, we can't just spin up a nucleus at will to do this. We excite these modes in the lab by smashing nuclei into each other and giving them some excess energy, and the various possible modes are excited randomly.
 > I mean, there isn't really anything that makes our cells any more special than bacteriaOur cells actually differ a LOT from bacterial cells in important ways. 1. Our cells are able to communicate with each other through a variety of specific and functionally distinct pathways that do not exist in bacteria (e.g. Notch-Delta, Hedgehog, canonical and noncanonical Wnt, TGF-beta, etc). This allows animal cells to talk to each other, and to set up local and spatial differences in cell identity, which then allows animals to produce different tissues in different places. 2. Our cells are capable of communicating at a distance, both by releasing diffusible proteins and by physical extensions. This means that our cells can produce macroscopic patterns, which then allows us to have tissue types and organs. 3. Our cells are capable of setting up and maintaining long-term changes in how the DNA code is read, which then allows us to have permanent cell fates. This is why a muscle cell can stay a muscle cell for a long period of time, instead of suddenly changing to a nerve cell or a fat cell depending on highly variable local factors. Without that sort of permanence or semipermanence, you simply cannot grow a body and expect it to keep its shape. 4. Our cells are able to connect to each other in ways that bacterial cells just cannot, such as tight junctions and via basement membranes. This allows our cells to come together to produce structures that are capable of bending and folding to create complex shapes, and to hold their shape under force. This is critical if you want to create complex organ systems (where cell folding is important in setting up different parts of the system) and if you want your organism to maintain tissue integrity (i.e. not fall apart under the slightest movement). 5. Our cells are capable of short-term changes in state that do not affect long-term cell identity. This allows cells to do things like generate action potentials, which is the basis of our nervous system, muscle function, and so on. Without that, animals would be unable to coordinate cell behaviors in order to accomplish organism-scale behaviors. In other words, yes, animal cells are very different from bacterial cells.
 They produce ATP in chloroplasts, but they *also* use aerobic respiration! Excess oxygen is released as a waste product, but they have no trouble using some of it again in the mitochondria.
 Because the lenses in it are designed to focus the image given a "healthy" eye. They *can* make a rift with the appropriate lenses to fit your eye but they don't. Many higher end photo cameras let you replace the view finder to fit your prescription so that you can use the camera without your glasses:_URL_0_
 Fission is a nuclear reaction. All that matters is the nucleus itself. It doesn't matter if the atom is part of a solid, liquid, or gas. The "chemical environment" of the atom has little affect on the nucleus, and therefore little effect on any nuclear reactions that the nucleus may participate in.
 Not that I've seen. They appear in diagrams all the time though, for instance singularities in Penrose diagrams are zigzag boundaries:  _URL_0_
 Follow up questions: What is better for muscular growth, working out and drinking, or not working out and drinking? How does timing come into play in such a circumstance?
 It's a good question, but it misses how most developmental genes work. There is no particular gene or set of genes that are only useful for building gills and nothing else. Rather, there are a core set of genes that regulate the development of the vertebrate body plan. That is, these genes - called transcription factors - switch on other genes that determine how a cell specializes or if it should die. Many of these are so highly conserved through evolution that you can actually replace a fly's with a human's and it will still work to develop the fly structure. The ultimate developmental trajectory ends up largely determined by when and where the transcription factors are expressed and what genes they are able to turn on/off at what times in what tissues. So, to get back to our original question, the genes that lead to the development of the gills in fish are just as active and functional in human development. However, they lead to the development of various cartilaginous portions of the throat in humans, I believe. That's probably simplifying things a good bit, but it's the gist of it. Someone with a background in developmental biology feel free to expand/correct. Also, I'd recommend reading the book "Your Inner Fish". It's pop Sci and addresses this very issue.
 Ok, first things first, endorphins are a mechanism (one of many), underlying the complex emotion we call "enjoyment." There are many other neurotransmitters involved in the experience of positive emotion (e.g., dopamine, 5HT), and there are aspects of enjoyment which don't depend upon any neurochemical in particular (e.g., the cognitive preprocessing which detects and categorizes an activity as "enjoyable" isn't localized or solely dependent on any single neurotransmitter). **tl;dr**Our brains are complex, multi-component systems there's no centralized "enjoyment" box. The second thing I notice is that your question seems to imply that enjoyment is always the same. That it's not possible to enjoy some parts of things and dislike others (i.e., have mixed feelings). That doesn't match my experience, nor the broader literature on emotion which stresses multiple interacting emotional systems. People watch sad movies and horror movies and seem to enjoy them, though they don't usually enjoy sadness or fear. **tl;dr**Enjoyment is a complex multi-component thing also. The third thing I notice is that you said "your brain." This is sort of a warning flag in neuroscience questions because it implies a difference between "you" and "your brain" (i.e., it's a dualist view of the world. The brain is different from the soul). There are some differences between those two concepts (e.g., your body, your social groups, your environment), but to a first approximation you = brain. Both you and your brain are complex and have multiple components, so you can have mixed feelings about things, and have internal disagreements when different components reach different conclusions, but to the extent that anyone anywhere has ever enjoyed anything ever it was because of a brain response. The weirdness in the question is that it seems to require you to be two people, the tricker and the trickee. If you know that you're smiling to increase your enjoyment of something that seems to me like you're training yourself to like it more. Since you (and thus, your brain) are aware of this, I can't figure out what the deception is. **tl;dr** Since you and your brain are roughly the same entity, you're training yourself, not tricking yourself. Ok, so with all those knowledge bombs dropped, your specific proposal is sort of workable: [facial feedback](_URL_0_) is a thing. (see especially the [buck](_URL_1_) paper which is a nice review).
 Adipose tissue tends to be laid down in a pattern, starting at the navel and hips. As it grows it will fairly quickly involve all of the skin (making the body "smooth") but will be very prominent in a few parts (while a very few may remain fatless even as the rest enter morbid obesity). When you lose fat, it retreats in the reverse pattern. So the first fat you lose should be the latest you put on, and the fat you lose to be fully ripped will have been with you since childhood.
 You'd have a transformer. This is essentially how some transformers are created. Both are wound on the same core.
 It depends on the alloy the needle is made from. Most ferromagnetic materials lose their magnetism once the external field is removed, but usually a small field lingers. Other alloys can retain the magnetism virtually indefinitely, and some minerals even magnetise themselves spontaneously ( magnetite being most famous ). In my experience most needles tend to retain a bit of magnetism, but not very much. It all depends on the properties of the alloy that was used to make the needle however.
 The answer depends on what you mean by "multiverse." To my knowledge there two main distinct uses of this word in science and popular science. The first refers to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which, like all other interpretations of quantum mechanics, is currently not falsifiable. However, it may be possible that advances in our theoretical understanding of theories *beyond* quantum mechanics will allow falsifiability of QM interpretations. The second refers to causally disconnected regions of space time, usually formed shortly after the big bang due to inflation. I'm not an expert here, so I'm not certain whether or not we can find evidence as to whether or not these things exist. If such evidence does exist however, I would suspect that it would be equivalent to finding evidence for the different inflationary models.
 Anytime you heat food, some nutrients are destroyed in the process, whether you use a conventional oven, microwave, or simply club your food and heat it over a camp fire. How much you heat it, how long you heat it, and how much water you use while heating it all play a role in how many nutrients are lost in the process. The other side to this is that heating your meals can also make it easier for our bodies to to break down and digest some foods, such as meat and vegetables. Making food easier to break down in turn means less energy and time is expended from our digestive systems to convert it, which in turn gives us more energy and time to pursue other interests. If done properly, most foods will retain more nutrients through microwaving over conventional methods mainly due to shorter cooking times, and as most microwave preparations require less water than conventional cooking, less nutrients are drained out as well. But what about microwaving in particular? Mankind has been heating meals for thousands or years, while microwaves have only recently been introduced in the last few decades. "Nuking" that pizza pop is a quick and easy way to get a hot meal and burn the roof of your mouth, but is it worse for you than firing up the oven? From an environmental standpoint a microwave can use much less electricity than a conventional oven, and is definitely quicker. Microwaving meat can also eliminate up to 90% of carcinogens over conventional heating, such as HCAs, which have been linked to several types of cancers. Of the two main types of radiation, ionizing and non-ionizing, only ionizing damages DNA. Microwaves use non-ionizing radiation, meaning it does not have the power to destroy DNA, contrary to many claims otherwise. That doesn't mean your microwave is completely safe either. There is still the dangers of super-heating or overheating your food, and of your microwave leaking radiation through faulty door seals while it is in operation, possibly burning you. However it's fairly simple to test your microwave to see if there may be an issue with leakage without any special equipment. Also, some things are not recommended to be microwaved, such as breast milk, because you are killing all the good bacteria and the antibodies that are beneficial to a developing child. sources_URL_2__URL_0__URL_3__URL_1_(Edit- added some clarity)
 You see young pigeons all the time. They are the ones that are a little drabber colored and whose necks do not have that iridescent sheen. They are almost the same size as adults. Like most altricial (=hatched naked) bird species, baby pigeons grow very rapidly and after just a couple weeks in the nest they are nearly adult size. So, once they're out of the nest, young are best distinguished from adults not by size but by their "juvenal" plumage. (Juvenal plumage is the first set of "real" feathers that a bird grows  &  is usually slightly different in color than adult plumage, usually plainer.) BTW pigeons are cliff nesters, and in cities they tend to stick their nests in sheltered spots high on the sides or tops of buildings. Most people never notice the nests but if you listen for the "ee ee ee" begging call of the nestlings you can find them pretty easily.
 One of the core ideas in cosmology is the [Cosmological Principle](_URL_0_), which is the assumption that the earth does not occupy a privileged position in the universe. Elements are numbered according to the number of protons in the nucleus, and are essentially unbounded, but only elements below uranium, at ~~88~~ 92, are stable enough to be found in nature. Elements up through Iron (26) are produced via fusion over the normal lifetime of large stars, and dispersed via supernova. During the actual supernova event itself, the rest of the elements are created. Given that virtually all of the giant Population III stars that formed during the early universe are believed to have gone supernova, it is reasonable to assume that the earth is not particularly privileged in its elemental abundance. You can make an anthropic argument that life did not arise surrounding the very first stars simply because even carbon had not been created yet, but I have an extremely hard time buying that for a planet in orbit around a Metal-rich star like the sun, or the billions like it in the milky way alone.
 It is an important case, because for telescopes e.g. there is no difference if you assume the star is some 1000light years away or if you assume it is at infinity. The light will go the exact same way in the lense system.
 Mostly sleeping problems and depression. Also said to lead to hypomania, which is characterized by persistent and pervasive elevated or irritable mood. I want to emphasize, though, that at the polar circle it is not dark all the time in winter. There are many hours where it is semi-dark, as in dim light. Due to all the snow reflecting light is is actually not as dark as one would imagine. [Layman Literature](_URL_0_)[Academic Literature](_URL_1_)
 Well there's a very simple relation betwen the altitude of your orbit and the speed it takes to maintaint it. From memory, the speed you need to maintain LEO (low earth orbit, about 300km above the surface) is 7km/s. To maintain a geostationary orbit (36.000km above ground), the speed required is such that you complete an orbit every day (I don't have the speed in mind, but you can do the math if you want to). If you're below or above that speed by a small margin you won't crash/escape, you'll just have a higher orbit eccentricity (meaning the higher and lower points of your orbit will have different altitudes). If the margin is too high though, you're in trouble. Also, in LEO drag is not negligible, for instance ISS has to be accelerated regularly to prevent it from slowing down too much.
 Trucks normally start in 2nd and only use 1st for steep descents or heavy loads, so their gear shift is optimized for 2nd/neutral shifting. Race cars spend most of their time in 2nd or 3rd and so the gear shift is optimized for 2nd/3rd shifting. Dog-leg gearbox makes 2nd/neutral and 2nd/3rd shifting easier than typical gearbox. _URL_0_
 Yes; namely under changes of inertial frames in relativity (Lorentz transformations) E and B fields mix into eachother. Super minimal example to show this: static charge, there's only an E field. You change reference frame, it gets moving and therefore part of the E has turned into a B. Said in modern words, this implies E and B must be part (components) of a larger object that "transforms well" under Lorentz transformations, that is to say it doesn't mix into anything else, just into itself. This object is the Maxwell tensor F.
 In evolution there is nothing "major". There is no intention, direction and purpose. There are random changes that are confirmed or rejected by the natural selection mechanism. What humans can add to this is their ability to intervene in the natural selection process - by keeping alive and allowing humans to reproduce who otherwise would not survive. So if there is anything "major" it is because of the medical development. Still, nobody can predict at this point what mutations would be confirmed by the aid of the medicine...
 Short answer no it isn't overkill. Not everyone has enough money to eat a sufficiently balanced diet and even those with plenty of money often don't eat well. As soon as there are no poor people and everyone is eating a balanced diet then we can probably stop fortifying foods in the first world.
 You can't alter the DNA itself, but you can alter the methylation of the DNA which determines how it is expressed. [for example](_URL_0_)
 The technical term is hyperkeratosis, which may help in searching the literature. The mechanosensitivity of cells (meaning their response to mechanical stress) leads to "increased cell cohesion, reduced shedding, and a thickening of the outer epidermal layer of dead skin" (Grouios *The Foot* 2004). Specifically, exposure to mechanical loads induces increased proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes (i.e., skin cells), increased collagen fibril diameter, and increased crosslinking of bonds within the collagen (collagen = connective tissue). The response appears to have evolved to prevent injury and subsequent infection. Note that this response is specifically associated with occasional loads on dry tissue; wet tissue tends to form blisters, and constant loading may result in tearing.
 Not to play a jedi mind trick on you, but there is no path. We desperately hang on to this classical notion that the world is made up of small particles. As if they were tennis balls, but just really tiny. If you go into any advanced form of modern physics this notion just crumbles. When you think about the "cloud" of an electron around the nucleus, it's not that the electron is hiding somewhere in the cloud. The cloud *is* the electron.
 It sounds like a [Pearson's chi-square test](_URL_0_) to look for independence is more what you are looking for. It is generally the most appropriate test when your predictor variable (A) is dichotomous and your outcome variable (B) is dichotomous. Can B occur outside of A? If so, you can put your data into a frequency table like this    AB   |   A0    ____________    0B   |   00where 'AB' is the number of times B occurs within A, 'A0' is the number of times A occurs without B, 0B is the times B occurs outside of A, and 00 is the number of segments with neither A nor BUse that to calculate the chi square statistic yourself (the wikipedia article can help) or use a stats package like R to do it for you.
 Well, the thing is, the pull of a black hole inside its event horizon goes to a kind of infinity - all possible paths in space-time end up in the center, no matter what forces are applied to a particle of matter. But there's nothing unique about the surface of an even horizon, which depends on the observer. The commonly referred surface is that for a stationary observer outside, but from a viewpoint falling in, nothing special ever happens at any surface, only a smooth, continuous plunge. An observer below the surface of an event horizon cannot see anything from below, but photons from the outside may still approach, from an ever-diminishing angle. Your idea of trying to pull part of an object back could never be demonstrated, because no (known) material is so strong. Here's a useful technique: let's have a thought experiment. What is an 'object'? Physicists like to do calculations in terms of infinitely small particles because the math is easier - a field takes a certain value at a point, and for example if that's an electric field and the particle is an electron or even, say, a particle of static-charged moon dust, it experiences a certain force as a body. Objects as we know them are simply then collections of particles that happen to be bound together by relatively strong forces. Those forces, however, pale in comparison to gravity around a black hole. A piece of high-tensile steel wire might as well be a noodle. Both are simply collections of atoms held together by electromagnetic forces, and this is the domain of gravity. There is no such thing as a whole object. There is nothing particular privileged about this collection of atoms in particular. Imagine you're orbiting the black hole, or being supported (briefly) by some absurdly powerful rockets. You extend a length of steel cable, or kevlar, or carbon nanotube - it doesn't matter - towards the center. At some point before the horizon, the summed forces along the wire, the stress, will be greater than the finite strength of the material, and it will tear off.
 A good place to start thinking about the differences between colonial organisms and multicellular organisms is their respective definitions. Colonies are defined as groups of organisms that closely associate but, if separated, are capable of survival on their own (I'm paraphrasing for the sake of brevity). Considering your different tissues in this respect makes it clear that separating your cells out (even in a medium that allows for continued existence) would still make it so that they could not reproduce or grow without substantial intervention. Of course there are other differences: for example how a unified biological organism develops and differentiates at the cellular level versus how a colonial organism (like Physalia physalis) becomes whole by a budding process for each of its different organisms (or zooids). This paper covers a lot of the developmental biology of these types of organisms: _URL_0_ .
 It's because on an LED display, all of the sections aren't lighting up at the same time. Instead, the display flips through the lit sections one at a time. Normally, this happens much too quickly for you to notice, but if you're chewing something, or if it's shaking, the different sections no longer line up as they flicker.
 The issue is usually with switching current off in inductive loads. The reason why this happens is, that there is some energy stored in the magnetic field inside your inductor, which causes the voltage spikes. The amplitude of the voltage is directly related to the inductance of the load. If we take a look at the [wikipedia page](_URL_1_):v=*L* di/dtI would say that the rise/fall times of transistors would be a good estimation for the time in which your transistor will turn off. The resulting spike will easily be high enough to cause damage to the transistor. If you're using relays to turn off your inductive load it's hard to tell, as there will generally be some arcing between the contact, when you're trying to disconnect. Also, there is a big difference if the current is AC or DC, but your relay datasheet should give you the maximum load that can be switched safely. Bonus question regarding loudspeakers:They actually have some significant inductance. The value is the actual *impedance* of the speaker, not it's DC resistance. The DC resistance for an 8 Ohm rated speaker would usually be around 6 Ohms or something like that. For any audio application, you would not generally have a DC component that you would want to turn off suddenly- this would not be very nice music at all, but yes, if you went out of your way to drive a loudspeaker with DC and suddenly (let's say withing microseconds or even quicker) turn the current off, you could very well damage your transistors. Thankfully, there is a very easy way to prevent any kind of damage to your electronics and this is to just connect a diode in parallel to your inductive load, but oriented so that it is polarized in reverse by your typical driving voltage. When you disconnect the load, the current will instead flow almost unimpeded in the other way through your diode and no significant voltage spike will be generated. This is called a [flyback diode](_URL_0_).
 >  Does gravity interact more strongly with gamma rays than radio waves? Sorta. I apologize in advance for how jargony and technical this is going to sound, but general relativity is hard. There's two ways to answer this question by general relativity. The first is to say, "The distribution of mass and energy tells spacetime how to curve, which determines the gravity of your spacetime." Since electric and magnetic fields can carry energy (and thus, so can photons), you can write a [stress-energy tensor for your electromagnetic fields. ](_URL_0_) Since a gamma ray is more energetic, it contributes more to the curvature than a radio wave. This can be obtained straightforwardly from the Einstein Field Equations. On the other hand, we don't often consider the electromagnetic contribution to spacetime curvature, because it is so small. For example, we're typically interested in the gravity around something like a planet, so if we approximate it as a point mass we get the [Schwarzchild Metric. ](_URL_1_) Once you have the metric, which contains all your information about distances and curvature and what not, you can solve for how particles will move - these are the 'straight lines through curved space,' which you may have heard called 'geodesics.' Since photons are massless, we get a special solution to the geodesic equations for their motion, which is not dependent on the energy of the photon. These are just 'null lines,' and a gamma ray and radio wave would behave the same way in this sort of solution. >  Would it be fair to say EM waves are like proto-particles that aren't "heavy" (energetic) enough to interact with the Higgs field? No. That's all something different. Photons simply *are* massless, and thus don't interact with the Higgs field. That's kind of a definition - if a fundamental particle is massless, you'll find that it doesn't interact with the Higgs field.
 You only sense light that enters your retina, you don't perceive the path that light takes in space. In foggy conditions, light bounces off of water (fog) in the air and is scattered in every direction, including that of your eye, outlining its path. Ordinarily it would continue right through the air uninterrupted, so you'd only see it at the source and any objects it reflected off of.
 Neutron stars are indeed super dense, so there will be an increased rate of neutrino collisions with the matter making up a neutron star. (Edit: keep in mind just how small neutron stars are as well: the size of a major city. They may be dense, but for a particle whizzing past at almost the speed of light it's like nothing's there) However, neutrinos are so weakly interacting that it's still pretty easy for them to just zip through a NS without noticing it's even there. Which has implications for the *cooling process* neutron stars undergo shortly after they are formed. After formation by supernova, a neutron star's internal temperature is around 10 billion Kelvin, with a surface temperature about 100 times less at 100 million K. At this surface temperature, the neutron star emits hard X-rays which carry away energy, thereby lowering its temperature. BUT the speed of this process is proportional to the surface area of the NS, which is quite small given the relatively small size of the object. So another process dominates the early cooling phase of neutron stars: neutrino cooling. The name for it is the modified URCA process. This is a bit simplified, but essentially neutrons in the interior spontaneously decay into protons, electrons, and antineutrinos via the processn - >  p + e^- +  ̅ν*_e_* ,where the symbol n denotes a neutron, p stands for a proton, e^- is an electron, and  ̅ν*_e_* denotes an electron antineutrino. Once these protons and electrons are created, they quickly find a friend in the other protons and electrons simultaneously being created by the same decay process throughout the neutron star and undergo inverse beta decay:p - >  n + e^- + v*_e_* ,where the symbol v*_e_* denotes an electron neutrino. Now both of these processes create an (anti-)neutrino which speeds off and carries energy out of the neutron star, lowering its temperature. Turns out the speed of this process goes as T^(8), while radiative cooling by X-rays goes as T^(4), so neutrino cooling is extremely fast for the first few thousand years, after which the temperature is low enough (decreased by a factor of 100 in just a few thousand years) that radiative cooling takes over as the dominant process.
 I'm going to assume your 1000 watt microwave is running at full power for ~2 minutes to heat up a cup of water. 1000 watts * 2 minutes / 60 minutes (in an hour) = .033 kWhA typical electric kettle will use 1500 watts over the course of ~1 minute to bring a cup of water to boiling. 1500 watts * 1 minute / 60 minutes (in an hour) = .025 kWhGiven, these numbers are very rough, but the result makes sense. When heating water in a ceramic cup in the microwave, a significant portion of the energy goes to heating the cup directly, and more energy is lost in general. Now for the kicker. Assuming your electric is charged at about $.12 per kWh, you're looking at a difference of $0.0096 in favor of the kettle. Yes, 0.96 cents. You'd save much, much, more by other means: Shutting down your 250w - 600w desktop computer / unplugging your 85w laptop power adapter overnight or changing light bulbs from 75 watt incandescent to 18watt CFL.
 The short answer is yes, it is indeed possible for light to interact with light, though it happens only at very high intensity, around 10^24 W/cm^2 for ~1 micron wavelength light (not far from realization in the laboratory given the present state and trajectory of high intensity laser technology). This is about two orders of magnitude higher in intensity than we can make in the laboratory today and will probably be reached in a decade or so, allowing for direct probing of quantum electrodynamics in the laboratory using high-intensity lasers. [This article](_URL_0_) describes one such experiment. The essential physics is that at high enough laser intensity, one starts to "polarize" the vacuum, creating virtual electron-positron pairs that interact with the incident light as a nonlinear dielectric. Such dielectric behavior of the vacuum allows for the creation of a "matterless double-slit" in the article. The physics of this process is described well by quantum electrodynamics. Your projectors are many, many orders of magnitude lower in intensity, so this bit of exotica is not occurring in your classroom. [Edit: fixed some awkward wording.]
 Yes, there would be recoil, by conservation of momentum.
 How do you think spacecraft reach other planets? Via random chance? For orbits around Earth, the usual approach is to use Earth-based coordinate systems, for interplanetary spacecraft it is more useful to consider the position relative to the Sun, like the [International Celestial Reference Frame](_URL_1_). There is also the [galactic coordinate system](_URL_0_).
 I just recently was reading on some articles in the Journal Nature that talked about the year roughly 25 as being fully developed especially in the front lobe which is the area of critical thinking. Makes sense when you think of the stupid things you do in your 20's that you would never do later in life. It is also why I tell everyone do party like a rock star early on and don't get married till you are older or have a kid because you are just not ready or grown enough to do it. I am sure if you do some google search you will come up with the article and the research it was very interesting.

 The classic perception of a "reptile" is neither taxonomically nor evolutionarily valid (ideally these would be the same thing!). Reptiles were basically defined by what they're *not*: they were animals that lay hard-shelled eggs that [aren't mammals or birds](_URL_4_). The term "reptile" was generally used to classify those cold, scaly animals into a group, but that completely ignores how they're all actually related. Crocs are far more closely related to birds than any other reptile. Non-mammalian [synapsids](_URL_0_) have been referred to as "mammal-like reptiles" even though they're more closely related to mammals than other reptiles. If you wanted to include everything classically referred to as a reptile in a monophyletic group, you'd just have a group with [every amniote](_URL_2_). So the group you're defining that includes mammals would be Amniota. Modern taxonomic groups must be made up of a common ancestor and all of that ancestor's descendents (and is referred to as "monophyletic"). The division of groups using anything other than monophlyly is arbitrary. It removes the context of evolutionary relationships. There has been an effort to [re-cast a monophyletic group as "Reptilia"](_URL_3_) that is basically the same as the pre-existing group [Sauropsida](_URL_1_). Both Sauropsida and this definition of Reptilia include all amniotes except those more closely related to mammals. That means mammal-like reptiles are excluded and birds are included. So it turns out that mammals aren't reptiles...but birds are.
 Yes and no. They do not have P53-mediated apoptotic mechanisms. There are others, though. [HAMLET](_URL_2_), for one. Another well studied system in *E. coli* is via the toxin-antitoxin *mazEF* pathway. [_URL_0_](1)Slightly more dated review [here](_URL_1_) as well.
 There is a nice explanation of how eukaryotic cells evolved, but the OP asked about multicellular life, which is a bit different. In some sense, multicellular life is pretty simple - you just need cells to decide it is easier to stick together than remain apart. Bacteria do this when they form a [biofilm](_URL_0_). However, many people don't define biofilms as multicellular life because they don't show nearly the level of specialization that animals, plants, and fungi do. So another question we could ask is why are eukaryotic cells able to form the complex multicellular organisms that aren't observed in bacteria and archaea. This boils down to the fact that eukaryotic cells seem to be capable of [differentiating](_URL_4_) into many cell types and these can form into distinct tissues and organs. So why can eukaryotic cells differentiate into so many cell types? Here we have to speculate, but one theory I heard proposed at a conference (can't remember the name of the speaker) was that [nucleosomes](_URL_2_) were a key factor. They are able to be modified through dozens of potential post-translational modifications, and that may provide more flexibility for epigenetic control. We really have a ways to go before we understand all the mechanisms that allow for [stem cell differentiation](_URL_1_) though, so we can't really prove that any one feature of eukaryotic cells was necessary for complex multicellular life to evolve. Whatever was necessary, multicellular life has [evolved more than once](_URL_3_), even if you only count "complex" multicellular life. [Plants and animals](_URL_5_) all evolved into multicellular organisms independently.
 This is absolutely the case; and we are able to map it out. _URL_0_
 I don't know an exact figure of how much nuclear energy has been released in nuclear weapons tests to date - but the [largest nuclear weapon ever detonated](_URL_1_) was 210 petajoules and to date there (officially) have been 2,434 nuclear weapons detonated in testing + 2 used in war. Assuming the average yield is 1/10 that of the Tsar Bomba (a number I pretty much just made up) that means ~51 exajoules (51x10^18 J) have been released in nuclear tests to date. For comparison, this is roughly the amount of energy that the world consumes in a month (humans consume [1.3 EJ/day](_URL_0_))
 [Link](_URL_0_) Converting insoluble amines into hydrochlorides is a common way to make them water-soluble. This is particularly desirable for substances used in medications. [1] The European Pharmacopoeia lists more than 200 hydrochlorides as active ingredients in drugs. [2] Compared to free bases such hydrochlorides may be quickly released in the gastrointestinal tract; the body usually absorbs a hydrochloride within fifteen or thirty minutes. Very often hydrochlorides of amines have longer shelf-lives than their respective free bases.
 This is because the scales in traditional western music have only 8 notes. If we didn't use different scales, then we would only need those 8 notes, but since we like to change between the scales, we need to be able to represent the other scales with the notes of the normal scale (Do major. I don't know how you write this with your A-G system). This ends up with the modern system of music notation
 First: Virtual particles are a calculational tool. You can also use calculational methods that do not utilize virtual particles. Virtual particles, therefore, never become real. Second: A single photon not interacting with anything can never produce an electron-positron pair. To see this easily, consider a frame in which the photon is so red shifted that its energy is less than twice the mass of an electron. In that frame, it is clear that the energy conservation prevents a photon to electron+positron process. In other frames, that also most hold, though it in general involves using both energy and momentum conservation to see this. So the kind of process you're talking about isphoton + object --- >   electron + positron + objectWhat is happening here is that the energy and momentum of the before particles are rearranged into the energy and momentum of the after particles. The only place virtual particles would be relevant here is that there are ways to calculate the likelihood of this process using virtual particles, but the outgoing electron and positron are not virtual particles made real.
 There is an analogous number called the[ Planck time](_URL_0_) but both this and the planck length are not in any way lower bounds for anything (in any current widely accepted theories) despite what the wikipedia page I linked says. They are derived from several natural constants and essentially represent a scale at which we know our current understanding breaks down. It's not a minimum pixel size or anything like that, it's just the scale at which we know we will need a real quantum gravity theory to figure out what's going on. Because these numbers arise so naturally it's likely they will appear in quantum gravity theories as important values, possibly even limits as popularly thought, but as of now all those theories are speculative.
 The gravitational strength difference is pretty small, but it might be noticeable. I don't have figures for the exact variance, but we can make a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of variation by considering the gravity at the average equator height and the gravity at the average pole height. At the equator, with Wikipedia's figures I get 9.86809008 m/s^2 . At the poles, 9.80013036 m/s^2 . This is a difference of about 0.7%. This does carry through to the height you'd expect to achieve on, say, a jump, so an identical high jumper who reaches two metres (that's a guess, I don't know how high they actually jump) at the equator might reach an extra centimetre at the pole, which might well be enough to affect a record.
 It depends. With structural analysis finding the general areas and different modes of fracture is more or less straightforward. However, the specific fracture crack pattern and exact positions are very difficult or impossible to calculate because the outcome is sensitive to very small differences and imperfections. Engineers need to know how, where, when, etc. a part will fail. They also need to know the speed a crack propagates and its general behavior. These things aren't easy, but they are certainly possible. Predicting the exact chaotic pattern of a fracture isn't generally useful or practically possible. More and more information will get you a better prediction, but there's certainly a point when it stops being interesting.
 Your error is here: >  As such, the train hits the fly with a massive amount of force, equal to the acceleration times the mass of the train. The force on the fly is the acceleration of the fly times the mass of the **fly**. The force on the train is the acceleration of the train times the mass of the train. These two forces are equal, which tells us that the acceleration of the fly is much larger than the acceleration of the train.
 It seems to be true within limits but of course very limited compared to modern techniques. to quote from [this website](_URL_0_)"When the western sky is especially clear, there is often a red sunset. That's because as the sun sets, its light shines through much more of the lower atmosphere, which contains dust, salt, smoke and pollution. These particles scatter away some of the shorter wavelengths of light (the violets and blues), leaving only the longer wavelengths (the oranges and reds.) If an area of high air pressure is present, the air sinks. This sinking air holds air contaminants near the earth, making the sunset even redder than usual. This would be the “red sky at night.” In the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere, weather systems most often approach from the west. Since high pressure generally brings fair weather, this type of red sky at sunset would indicate that clear weather is approaching, which would "delight" a sailor. If the sky is red in the eastern morning sky for the same reasons as above, then the high pressure region has most likely already passed from west to the east, and an area of low pressure may follow. Low pressure usually brings clouds, rain or storms, a warning for sailors."
 Typically they have extremely low pH in their stomach acids which is enough to kill off pathogens which would be harmful to humans. Carrion feeders like Vultures have stomach pHs of around 1-2 ([Houston and Cooper 1975](_URL_0_)). More standard carnivores like lions also have pH around 1 in their stomachs, whereas a human's is up near 3/4.
 Depends on the cause of blindness. One thing you should be aware of is that circadian rhythm doesn't actually depend on light input, but is modulated by it. This means that in your central nervous system (more specifically the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is located right where the 2 optical nerves cross), circadian rhythm is intrinsically created (kind of like an internal clock that is always ticking). The neuronal patterns generated are then transmitted to a structure called the pineal gland where the hormone melatonine is secreted. However, and this is evident in the name of the phenomenon "circadian" (about a day long), the rhythm generated in the SCN is not exactly 24 hours, but (depending on the individual) 22 to 25 hours long. In order to correct for this, the SCN is synchronized with the amount of light hitting the retina of the eye. The important structural component here are the intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC). These are specialized receptors of the eye that, unlike cones and rods, detect light stimuli on the retina without intermediate calculations - while rods and cones are seperate receptor cells that transmit information to intermittent nerve cells (bipolar cells) under influence of interneuron systems until the information finally hits the nerve fiber of the optical nerve, the ipRGC are just straight up modified optical nerve fibers that are intrinsically capable of detecting light. ipRGC are incapable of sensing color, intensity, shape or movement of objects however, and are strictly unconscious because their input is only lead to the SCN via the optical nerve. In summary: rhythm is generated like a clock in the SCN whose input induces melatonin secretion, the unprecision is corrected for when light hits the ipRGC (blue light, most prevalent during the day, is the strongest activator of the ipRGC). This means that we are capable of sensing day-night rhythm without actually seeing day and night, but our "natural", uninfluenced rhythm is quite far off from our surroundings and will asynchronize over the course of a few days. A person whose circadian light detection is not properly working will experience gradual shifts in their sleep wake rhythm, e.g. will one day go at 10 pm to sleep, then because their rhythm is 25 hours long the next one 11 pm, then 12 pm, then 1 am, then 2 am and so on. There was actually a famous experiment of a person who lived in a dark cave without natural light (only non-blue artificial light) and always reported when he was going to sleep; his sleep patterns were also gradually shifting. This also happens to blind people, but not all: only blindnesses associated with the destruction of the retina or with lesions of the optical nerve. As long as the ipRGC and the optical nerve are intact, and they still get light, circadian rhythm operates fine. For the rest of blind people a lot of them do have to fight with severely inconsistent wake-sleep rhythms and have a hard time going to bed the same time every day.
 Here's a fun fact: It never does. Most of the time, you can kind of ignore relativity. Stuff moves really slowly relative to other stuff, gravity gradients are shallow, on a large scale the universe is basically so close to being Euclidean that we can pretend it is for purposes of conversation. But black holes are different. You can't even start thinking about black holes until you understand the fundamental ideas of general relativity, because without that understanding, it's all just gibberish and bullshit. So here's a fundamental idea of general relativity to start with: Relative to a thing far away, time passes more slowly for an object close to some source of gravity. Like here at sea level on Earth, my clock is ticking more slowly than it would be if I were on top of a hundred-mile-tall tower or something. Of course, the difference between the two is on the scale of microseconds per day, so we can ignore it (that's what I meant by on a large scale the universe is really close to being Euclidean). But the difference between a thing close to the event horizon of a black hole and a thing far away from one is *huge,* because the difference in the "strength" of the "gravitational field" (more properly, the degree of spacetime curvature) is a lot more different between those two points than it is between two points near the Earth's surface. Now, the closer you get to a source of gravitation, the greater the difference in spacetime curvature between where you are and a point far away, meaning your clock runs *even more slowly* than the distant clock does. Meaning the amount of time between ticks of your clock is one second in your frame of reference, but many seconds — maybe even many *years* — in the frame of reference of a distant observer. A black hole takes this fact to its logical conclusion. If it were possible to park a clock exactly at the event horizon of a black hole and observe it from a distance, you'd find that the time in the observer's frame between ticks of that clock is *infinite. * Literally infinite seconds have to pass on the distant observer's clock between two ticks of a clock magically parked exactly on the event horizon. Meaning no matter ever "reaches the singularity" of a black hole. Not ever, not ever, not ever. Anything that is observed falling toward a black hole will grow dimmer and dimmer (due to gravitational redshift of light, which I didn't bother to explain but you can look up) until it is no longer observable by anybody, and then after many many billions of years the black hole will radiate the fundamental quanta that made up that thing back out into space again as Hawking radiation. There's no scenario in which a distant observer can say that anything *ever* crossed the event horizon. Instead, everything just approaches the event horizon asymptotically (that means ever-closer but never reaching), but got scattered back out into space again in some finite time.
 More than likely, if made practical, quantum processing will be for solving niche problems and may not be the most efficient way to work with general computation. I imagine that the transister CPU will live alongside the quantum processor, the latter being used at universities and governments while your CPU + GPU combo plays all the latest games. For example, I knew someone who tried to run a MUD game (think text based WoW) on an underutilized older Cray supercomputer at a university in the mid to late 90s. This computer's architecture was designed to run big computation jobs consisting of floating point units, but the game was written so that it does integer math (damage is random(50) then minus your hitpoints (another integer)). The game ran incredibly slow even though it was running on a supercomputer. Slower than a 486 PC running linux, but if you were to feed it floating point based problems like weather simulation it would blow the doors off anything under 1 million dollars.
 Electrons are not made up of anything. They are electrons. As far as we can tell, with the current models of physics, they're elementary. Protons contain quarks like you said. What binds them? The strong interaction/strong force. None of these things have a "shape" though. Those pictures are just to make it easy for everyone to internalize the concept of an atom.

 The answer is "all of them". Every single fundamental frequency and every single harmonic for each string vibrates. There is not one single frequency. Different frequencies add together. Check out some images of adding sine waves: [one](_URL_0_), [two](_URL_2_), [three](_URL_1_). Can you say that any of those "has a frequency that it vibrates at"? No -- they are just simply many frequencies vibrating all at once. Only the pure sine wave (or cosine) has a single frequency at which it vibrates. Even a triangle wave, or a saw wave or a square wave, which is simple enough to say "it has a frequency", [actually is many frequencies added together. ](_URL_3_) When you refer to the frequency of a square wave you are actually referring to the fundamental frequency of the square wave, because the shape and harmonics are well-known and you don't need to specify them. But for any other sound other than a sine wave -- speech, guitar strumming, chords, drums, etc -- they are just many frequencies all playing at once.
 The goal is not to avoid any possible contamination - if we would do that, we wouldn't send probes at all. Possible contamination should be as unlikely as reasonably possible. If we can let a spacecraft burn up in the atmosphere of the gas giant, that is done. A lander cannot do that, of course, so it will get sterilized as good as reasonably possible. The Mars rovers avoid regions where liquid water temporarily could exist underground today, for example.
 [The journey into a black hole](_URL_0_). What you feel when falling into a black hole depends on its mass. The bigger its mass is, the lower are the tidal forces. Small black holes would be really a pain because of the extreme tidal forces. In bigger black holes you could pass the horizon unmolested.
 It could be many different things. I would suggest talking to a psychologist about it as any advice given here would be medical advice and therefore inappropriate.
 Laws of physics are heavily reliant on the constancy of the speed of light  in a vacuum (*c*), in that nothing can travel faster than it - *nothing*. This encompasses **all** information, such as data, movement etc. and therefore communication between two points is impossible to achieve in times less than the time a photon (particle of light) would take to travel between the two points. Additional note: the only way anything can travel *at* the speed of light in a vacuum is if it is massless, and nothing exists other than light itself with such a property. Note 2: I say 'the speed of light *in a vacuum* because light slows down when passing through a medium, such as air. In this case it is possible for other particles to travel faster than light in that medium, but still at less than *c*.
 It's a super absorbent polymer like sodium polyacrylate. The regular polymer will just create a giant gelatinous mass (used in baby diapers) but what you have in that picture is a variation with crossed links that results in the individual grains (used as fake snow in some applications).
 This [link from NASA](_URL_0_) should help answer your question.
 1) Well, part of it is just sheer combinatorics. In particular with organic chemistry, if you just use a subset (C, N, O, H and perhaps a few more) you can more or less stick to the basic Lewis Octet rule (C has 4 bounds, N has 3, O has 2, H has 1) and _almost_ anything you could come up with would be stable, as long as it wasn't too geometrically constrained. (In other words, you can predict a lot of chemistry with stick models. Which is why we use them)But what I think you're really getting at (and which aeter777 also answered), seems to be why molecules don't fall apart into their most stable form. And to recap that, there are two reasons: Kinetic and thermodynamic stability. The latter refers to the total energy of the molecule relative the molecule(s) that can react to form it. "Kinetic stability" refers to the energy barrier that the molecule has to overcome during the reaction. A common way you can visualize this is as a "potential energy landscape", where the latitude and longitude represent different locations for the atoms, and the height is the energy. (you might want to refer to the picture in the link) The low points (local minima) on that landscape are the stable molecular conformations. They don't just sit at the bottom though; molecules move, their bonds stretch and stuff, depending on the temperature. In that picture, thermodynamic stability means one valley is deeper than the other; that molecule has a lower total energy. Things try to minimize their energy, like water flowing to the lowest point, so things will try to react to 'reach' the thermodynamically most stable forms. But there's a problem - it's not enough that one valley is deeper than the other - it has to _get there_, too. The molecule needs to have enough kinetic/thermal energy to get over the energetic 'barrier' between the valleys. Which is why it usually takes heat to initiate a chemical reaction, even if it's exothermic. That's what 'kinetic stability' refers to. It means that there's such a high energetic barrier that the reaction either doesn't occur, or occurs very slowly. One example is the conversion of diamond to graphite. Graphite is more thermodynamically stable at room temperature/pressure, but the energetic barrier is so high, it occurs astronomically slowly. For all practical intents, diamond is stable. 2) Well, that's what's chemistry is all about! It depends on what you want to do. If you want to turn oxygen gas and carbon into CO2, that's no problem - because CO2 is the most thermodynamically stable form of those two molecules. So you can just apply lots of heat (enough to break the C-C bonds in graphite) and let it all react in a big, uncontrolled, combustion reaction. But things aren't always that simple of course, which is why we need chemistry. First you have some general 'levers' you can pull, such as temperature, pressure and pH. Depending on the reaction, that can change which form is the thermodynamically-favored one. For instance, at high pressures, diamond becomes energetically favored over graphite. (But the _kinetic_ barrier is still high, so you need high temperatures for the reaction to occur at any speed. But that in turn requires even higher pressures to keep diamond stable. To the extent it's not possible to actually synthesize diamonds that way)The way most organic synthesis is done, is by breaking the reaction down into smaller reaction steps, where you can remove any unwanted by-products after each step. The third way, is to use a _catalyst_. That's a molecule that doesn't get used in the reaction, but which lowers the kinetic barrier of some reaction. It's like raising the temperature, in that more molecules can then react, but unlike temperature, it can do so for one _specific_ reaction path. Unlike heat, which affects _all_ possible reaction paths. For instance, the catalytic converter in a car catalyzes the reaction between carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, into CO2 and N2 (eliminating the toxic nitrogen oxides). Almost all reactions in living things are catalyzed by proteins called enzymes. So when your body 'burns' sugar and oxygen into CO2, it doesn't require a burning-hot temperature to do so. A catalyst can be something as simple and passive as a metal surface (as in the automobile catalytic converter), or something massively intricate as an enzyme (which often contains tens of thousands of atoms). So, finding new synthesis pathways and finding new catalysts is very much what chemistry is all about. You can essentially turn anything into anything (as long as the basic elements are there), as long as you have a reaction pathway or catalyst to do so. There are many 'theoreticals', kinetically stable molecules we're almost certain should be able to exist, but where we don't know of any way to synthesize them in practice.
 Ask science: How cool are spaceships going to be? Scientifically speaking.
 This depends a lot on what you mean by "better", and also on the car and driving conditions. In no particular order...For pure stopping power, you want to brake as hard and as fully as possible without either locking the brakes or going into an uncontrolled skid. The stopping power is always dependent on the traction the tires have on the road, not just the friction of the brake pads on rotors. Most modern passenger cars have some kind of anti-lock brakes, meaning, for maximum emergency stopping power, you should generally stomp on the brake pedal as hard as possible and let the automated controls "pulse" the brakes to control the deceleration. If you do not have anti-lock brakes, then you may need to manually "pump" the brakes for hard stopping or wet-road conditions, to avoid locking up the brakes/wheels and going into an uncontrolled skid. That becomes a more complicated question. - For overall fuel-economy and vehicle-life in everyday driving, the best approach is usually to drive in a fashion that minimizes brake-usage as much as possible: e.g., leave plenty of room ahead of you, coast to stops as much as possible, decelerate by taking foot off the gas early rather than by putting foot on the brake, etc. - Following the above, it doesn't much matter in a strict engineering sense whether you achieve the same amount of deceleration with long, continuous pressure or intermittent pulsing, both involve the same amount of friction to achieve the same stopping power. - "Pumping" the brakes to control heat-dissipation would require more skill than I think any human driver has (the strategy would be to hit only "cold" patches of the rotor on every rotation). This qualifies as over-engineering, *unless* your car lacks anti-lock brakes *or* there is something special about the driving conditions. - Driving in difficult/unpredictable conditions such as snow/mud/puddles etc can sometimes test the limits of anti-lock brakes. In such conditions, it can be useful to frequently pump the brakes to dry them and test them. - The above should be used with caution: on icy or wet roads, where partial skid/hydroplaning can occur, it is best to shift into low gear and to drive *into* the skid with foot off the pedals, to allow the wheels to regain traction  in a direction where they are not fighting the momentum of the car. PS-- brakes will always over-power the engine, and most modern automatic transmissions are smart enough to accommodate braking. In fact, automatics are usually better than even extremely-skilled drivers when it comes to most emergency handling. Skilled stick-shift sports driving is about things like controlling skids and maximizing acceleration. Automatics are better at ending the skid and regaining traction.

 For the first question, **we don't know**, but *almost surely* at least ~~200,000~~ ~~100,000~~ 500,000 years (sorry, I forgot about Neandethals when I was first writing this answer...silly me). Let me answer the bonus question next, and then I'll give a few thoughts on your main question. The place to start is with the genetics. An offspring gets one copy of each gene from each of it's parents, so generally two organisms will fail to be able to reproduce if there are any genes that they contribute are somehow incompatible with one another. There are two principal kinds of genetic incompatibilities: those which impact *viability*, and those which impact *fertility*. If it's *viability* that is impacted, this can be at any point during the course of the organism's development, up until sexual maturity. So for example you could have some combination of genes that causes embryos to abort early in development, or causes death or severe disability in early childhood or adolescence, etc. Alternatively, you could have a genetic combination which does not interfere with the offspring's survival, but just makes them infertile. Maybe they produce sperm that swim in circles or eggs which don't start developing when fertilized. The simplest genetic model you might think of for an incompatibility is the following. At some particular gene there are two different alleles: the A allele, and the a allele. Individuals who have two copies of A, or two copies of a are normal and healthy, but individuals who have one of each (i.e. [heterozygotes](_URL_3_)) have some defect, due to the two different alleles interacting with one another negatively (for any of the reasons discussed above). This is called *underdominance*. Examples of it are rare in nature however, for the following reason. If there are both A alleles and a alleles in a population, then one of them must have formed via mutation from the other (e.g. let's say the a allele is derived from the ancestral A allele). When that mutation first occurred the first individual to carry the new a allele would necessarily be heterozygous, and therefore at a disadvantage. The new a mutation is thus unlikely to spread, and never gets off the ground. Most mutations which cause genetic incompatibilities *between species* likely are not of this kind. Instead, genetic incompatibilities between species generally involve at least two loci. For example, imagine a case where all individuals in species X have A alleles at gene 1 and B alleles at gene 2. Then, imagine species X splits into two different populations, and in Population 1 theres a mutation to an a allele at gene 1, which eventually spreads through the population, such that all individuals have aaBB genotypes. In Population 2 on the other hand, a mutation to a b allele at gene 2 eventually spreads through the population, so that all individuals have AAbb genotypes. When individuals from Population 1 and Population 2 try to produce offspring together, some of the offspring will have both a and b alleles together, which may interact poorly and cause reproductive isolation. These are called [Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities](_URL_1_), or "DMIs". DMIs also don't have to be pairwise. You could also imagine having three way interactions in which some three locus genotypes are bad, but others are ok. It's believed that these higher order interactions may contribute to speciation, but they are generally very hard to detect, largely for statistical reasons. You can flip the above scenario around a bit and have a good explanation for how a descendant population could come to be reproductively isolated from their ancestors. Imagine the ancestral population all had aaBB genotypes, and then the A mutation swept through the population, replacing the a allele, so that everyone was AABB. *Then*, the b allele sweeps through, replacing B, so that everyone is AAbb. If these individuals somehow had the opportunity to try to reproduce with their aaBB ancestors, they would produce some offspring that have a and b alleles together, resulting in bad things and therefore reproductive isolation. It's also worth noting that in general a lot of the time it's probably not single pairwise interactions completely shutting down reproduction on their own, but likely many such interactions, all of which add up to cumulatively cause severe problems. Now, back to your main question. The reason I say 500,000 is because that represents a good bound on the divergence of modern humans from Neanderthals, and [we know that all modern non-Africans have about 1-4% Neanderthal DNA in their genomes](_URL_0_), and [we know that the interbreeding happened about 50,000 years ago](_URL_4_), so we know that modern humans of that time were interfertile with Neanderthals. There is also evidence that [regions that are under stronger functional constraint have lower amounts of Neanderthal introgression](_URL_2_), suggesting that there has been selection against Neanderthal genes in modern humans, and thus that partial reproductive isolation may have already begun to evolve.
 ARP is used to communicate locally--- i.e. on the same network. ARP is actually a protocol used to learn hardware addresses called 'MAC' addresses. MAC is a hardware address, while IP is a logical address (MAC is burned into your network interface card, while IP is just assigned by you or whatever your preferred DHCP client gives you). So if we connect 3 computers to a switch and none of the computers have IP addresses, they can still technically communicate with each other through WINS and MAC. Hell, the computer really doesn't know what to even DO with an IP address--- if these three computers had IP addresses and you told computer A to communicate with computer B via IP address, it would use said 'ARP' protocol to find out what computer B's MAC is. IP addressing is needed when communicating with computers on different networks. Your computer actually needs to have the MAC address of a router in its ARP cache, and it just sends a frame up to that router, which turns it into a packet and sends it to the next hop IP address. So, in essence, you can put in a static ARP entry of a computer AND a static IP address of the same computer and it would all be cool, as long as the information is correct.
 You are assuming they have the same [IPC](_URL_0_) and that the clock frequency is the only thing that matters. [Here](_URL_1_) is some more information.
 Humans are animals, and the most fundamental sexual attractors between animals are [pheromones](_URL_0_), which depend on the sense of smell, not sight. Humans' sense of smell is poor compared to many other animals, but it is still vital. In addition to smell, we also respond to sound. Whose voice, like that of a songbird, appeals to us? (Somebody married Fran Drescher.) Finally, unlike most animals, humans form bonds based on intellect, shared interests, and social compatibility. So, while, the sense of sight may play a role in the first minutes of attraction, the other mechanisms have far more influence in engaging lasting bonds. I can not see sight has any role at all in sexual preference.
 We aren't. The Moon is reaching perigee every 4 weeks as it always has, and on average its perigee coincides with the full moon a few times a year (depending on how you define it). We're hearing about it more because the media has recently discovered that they can get people to click on their articles by hyping the supermoon, despite the fact that the difference in size is not noticeable.
 Sometimes it's not out of fear, it's out of disgust. I'm not sure if animals feel disgust and I don't know of any objective way to prove that 100%. I personally think people can confuse their "fear" of bugs with disgust. They may say they're scared, even though logically they know that the bug can't harm them, they just think it's gross. I hate anything that flies. It always flies right in my face. I'd rather encounter a snake than a cockroach. And I'm not scared of cockroaches, they're just really disgusting. I'm a layman, and normally I'd stay out of a topic, but this seems like one of those that can't be answered with any certainty.
 That's not the Milky Way, it's the [Andromeda Galaxy](_URL_0_), our nearest major neighbor. In a lot of respects it's thought to be fairly similar to the Milky Way-- a bit more massive,  with a slightly lower star formation rate, but generally being a run-of-the-mill spiral galaxy with some small dwarf companions.
 Neither. It's a long story — a semester-long story, to be frank — but the short version is that the speed of light is what *infinite rapidity looks like* to a differently moving observer. A fundamental truth about the universe is that differently moving observers will disagree about, well, lots of stuff. We can explain this very well mathematically; it's not mysterious at all, and in fact is rather mundane once you get down to it. But one of the consequences of that is that things can be instantaneous without looking instantaneous. Consider what it means for something to move "instantaneously" from one point to another point. It means it does it in zero elapsed time, right? Well, photons "move" from point A to point B in zero elapsed time; they "move" instantaneously. It's just that in our universe, differently moving observers disagree on how long things take, so light *appears* to propagate through space at a finite speed. But that "finite speed" is kind of an optical illusion, in a sense, and equates to instantaneous propagation through non-Euclidean spacetime.
 No, our sexual urges are no less controllable than your own. That having been said, it can be quite difficult for anyone to reign in their more dangerous impulses when they feel isolated and despised with few, if any, reliably safe methods of seeking help/support with their struggles. Which puts us at particular risk to offend for reasons owing more to our general life situations than specifically to our attractions.
 Find a brand that sells a fluoridated and a non-fluoridated toothpaste. Ask your flatmate/wife/girlfriend to paste your toothbrush with one of the pastes each night, not telling you which. At the end of 2 weeks compare which nights you dribbled everywhere with incidences of using the fluoridated toothpaste. Or not, perhaps.
 I'm not sure what you're asking for specifically, but I'll give it a stab:There was a fish, the [coelacanth](_URL_1_), an old lineage of lobe-finned fishes more related to mammals, reptiles, and lungfish than their ray-finned counterparts. It was found in the fossil record and assumed to have been extinct since the Cretaceous. In 1938 a fisherman pulled one up off the east coast of South Africa. In a cruel irony, the two species in the order are both threatened, the Indonesian being vulnerable and the West Indian Ocean being critically endangered. Coelacanths have been called living fossils because of how little they seem to have changed relative to their fossil specimens. They're also an example of what's called a [Lazarus taxon](_URL_0_), being some group of organisms that disappear from the fossil record and reappear later. That Wikipedia page has an entire list of species that were thought extinct but later somebody found more of still alive. Some of them are heartbreaking because they've only been seen again in a few unconfirmed sightings since they seemingly died out and it feels almost as if one should brace against the letdown by not believing the return. (i.e. The ivory-billed woodpecker is my personal favorite of these, if one can have a favorite among these tragedies.) **TL;DR** If your question is as I take it, yes, there almost certainly are more species out there that we thought extinct but which still have living members yet undiscovered, going by the growing list of [Lazarus taxa](_URL_0_).
 In general, the process that transports sediment leads to characteristic differences between various aspects of deposits of sediments including the shape of grains, the distribution of sizes of grains, and the size and type of [bedforms](_URL_2_) within the deposit. For Mars, certainly eolian (wind blown) deposits and processes are important, but for the particular deposits that are considered to be likely deposited by flowing water the observed characteristics are more consistent with fluvial (water) deposition. At the simplest level, this is done by comparison between deposits on Earth and Mars, for example [this Science paper](_URL_0_) or this [longer and more detailed Journal of Geophysical Research paper](_URL_1_). There are also mathematical arguments based on calculations of the necessary shear stress to entrain (pick up, essentially) and transport observed grains sizes, shapes and densities to demonstrate that for many of these deposits, wind is not a feasible mechanism. TL;DR - Not all sediment is the same, distributions of sizes and shapes of sediment can tell us whether grains were moved by water, wind, or other processes.
 My understanding is that a single loop rail gun is the one portrayed in every diagram: two rails, high current, and a projectile that it flows through. A quick wikipedia search suggests an augmented rail gun sinks current elsewhere, not (only?) across the projectile. By doing so, you can design rails that put more magnetic field over the projectile (I'm thinking a coil around the rails maybe?). I'm still looking for details concerning series vs parallel augmented railguns
 Howdy. In the video clip, there doesn't seem to be any shot of the pangolin actually running, just walking. There are many differences between walking and running, and from a human point of view the main difference is that running involves a short period of time when both the limbs are off the ground. So by that definition the pangolin isn't running, and I'd be surprised if they ever do. You're right that for many species speed is important in evading predators, but pangolins are covered in those keratinous scales (basically like fingernails), and when a predator gets close to them, they roll up into a little armored ball (like this: _URL_0_). So moving fast isnt really a high priority for them. What is a high priority though are those massive claws that they use to dig up ants and termites. And in evolving those giant claws, they've really sacrificed the ability to use their hands and forelimbs for locomotion. The claws just really arent meant for bearing weight and walking and running. So instead, most of the time they walk around on two legs (bipedally) just like us. But if you watch the video closely, they will put their hands on the ground for short periods of time, presumably for balance. So really the way they walk is just kind of a byproduct of the fact that they have those massive shovels on either hand. Also fun fact, pangolins are the only other mammals (I believe) that walk bipedally in the same way that humans do, by taking alternating steps (L,R,L etc). Most other bipedal mammals hop.

 Snce this has gone unanswered for so long, I'll throw in my paleontology-enthusiast opinion. It looks like the top of a young creature's skull to me, and the 'fin' looks like a large sagittal crest, [like on this badger](_URL_0_). My first thought was that it looked like a young dog, but I don't know. If it is a sagittal crest, then it is something with powerful jaws.
 Gene therapy is a means of delivering a useful gene (DNA sequence) that may be transcribed and translated into proteins in the patient's cells in the same way all other genes are. For example, patients with hemophilia lack a gene that codes for a signalling molecule that's essential for thrombosis (blood clotting). In hemophilic rats, scientists have delivered the gene required to produce this signalling molecule, and the rats showed a newfound ability to clot their wounds. The cause of cystic fibrosis is a gene mutation (explained fairly well [here](_URL_0_)), and thus gene therapy for this disease would be accomplished by delivering a copy of the unmutated gene.
 Ann Arbor is east of Marquette, but still in the same time zone. So if the day lengths were the same, you'd expect both sunset and sunrise to be earlier in Ann Arbor. However, Ann Arbor is also further south than Marquette. In the (northern) summer, that means Marquette has a longer day than Ann Arbor. For sunrise, these effects partially cancel out. Marquette's longer day means it has an earlier sunrise, while Ann Arbor being further east means it has an earlier sunrise too. It happens that these effects have about the same size right now, so sunrise is about the same time in both. But Marquette has a longer day, so it can't also have the same sunset time. Here the effects actually add together. Ann Arbor has an earlier sunset because it's further east, and Marquette has a later sunset because it's further north and has a longer day. So Marquette ends up with a doubly late sunset. The differences aren't huge though, because these two locations are still pretty close to each other.
 The de Sitter temperature (i.e cosmological constant dominated universe) takes on a form similar to the Hawking—Unruh temperature. In natural units it looks like,      T = (1/2pi)/R = (1/2pi)*H    R = event horizon radius      H = Hubble constantThe notable feature is that the weaker the cosmological constant (bigger radius, smaller Hubble constant), the weaker the temperature an inertial observer sees. This should be a stable situation as the horizon is absorbing as much as it is emitting, so we don't need to account for any excess energy anywhere. * Narnhofer et al. [How Hot Is the de Sitter Space? ](_URL_1_)  * _URL_0_
 Last time I've heard this topic come up, I believe it was still being debated, so there isn't a clear answer yet. First off, yes, there is evidence that sperm mitochondria are targeted for degradation. It is not a simple matter of sperm mitochondria dilution. The sperm tail is not excluded from the embryo upon fertilization. [There is a good sobering review on misconceptions in this area](_URL_4_) that I was happy I skimmed again. It is hypothesized that the reason may be an evolved protection from inheritance of damaged sperm mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Sperm require heavy usage of their mitochondria, so they generally are exposed to reactive oxygen species (by product of electron transport chain metabolism) during sperm creation and throughout the fertilization process. This can, in theory, [have deleterious effect on their mtDNA](_URL_2_). The female egg mitochondria are relatively quiescent, perhaps maintaing mtDNA integrity. Another hypothesis that comes up and one protective mechanism that may serve in addition to the one above is to avoid [intragenomic conflict](_URL_5_) and problems that may arise from having two competing genomes. Though this topic is a little outside the scope of my knowledge as it pertains to human mitochondrial genetics, but there is some info about it on [WikiPedia](_URL_0_). I did some checking to make sure this is accurate and it seems as if it still represents the current thinking of the field. Here are some reviews on the specific topic you can take a look at that backup what I wrote and can be used to find further reading. They should be freely available[Fertilization and elimination of the paternal mitochondrial genome](_URL_3_)[Ubiquitinated sperm mitochondria, selective proteolysis, and the regulation of mitochondrial inheritance in mammalian embryos. ](_URL_1_)
 Aspirin and ibuprofen are both anti-inflammatory analgesics, which work by inhibiting production of prostaglandins, a group of lipid compounds which produce soreness and inflammation. They do not target specific pain, but rather circulate until they encounter a location which is producing prostaglandins, where they act as antagonists. Therefore, any benefit that either of these two drugs possess in regards to targeting specific pain is likely a result of the placebo effect.
 When a material "rusts", it oxidizes. Oxidation is a chemical process in which the material combines with oxygen (or in fact, with any similar species which provides a stable electron configuration), and this oxidation occurs spontaneously. "Rust" as in the familiar orangey-brown substance you see on old steel, is just one example of the resultant oxide. In this case, iron oxide. Aluminum oxide, by comparison, is silvery-white in appearance, and Chromium oxide (which forms a protective layer on stainless steel) looks similar to the base metal. In all cases, you have one species being oxidized and one being reduced, and to facilitate the electron exchange, you need a conductive medium (the electrolyte), which is why mild steel rusts so readily in salt water.
 The short answer is that some of these are scalar quantities and so the change in value is all that matters since the game is made up and the points don't matter... I would direct you to any good text on geochemistry for a more exhaustive discussion. I like Anderson's treatment (Thermodynamics of Natural Systems) but preferences vary... some people like cold toilet seats. Failing that -- especially if you've done the textbook thing-- look up the seminal papers by Helgerson, Kirkham, and Flowers. The discuss how minimal information (crystallographic radius and heat capacity, as determined by old school calorimetry) can get you damn nearly everywhere else you need to go. If you add the work of Amend to the HKF trio, you can get everything* you need to know from crystallographic radius. *almost
 Just because it exists doesn't mean it was necessarily beneficial. I can't really speak to this so I'll let experts answer your question for sure. I would just like to bring up that point since it seems to be a common misconception.
 It's more a matter of maintaining control over the aircraft with such a slim margin for error than a matter of simple physics. We also need to consider issues of complex airflow within the tunnel, including ventilation and thermal drafts, as well as the turbulence created by the aircraft. Given that [the current largest diameter tunnel stands at about 15.5 meters (or 50 feet 10 inches)](_URL_1_), and most fighter jets have an approximate 40 foot wingspan, I know I wouldn't want to try anything more daring than a thread-the-needle type of exercise with a soft ring of cardboard and balsa wood in a fighter. An [ultralight aircraft](_URL_0_) with smaller wingspan and slower airspeed might be more appropriate to a tunnel traversal attempt.
 They do not have to pierce the skin of a live animal, but in laboratory settings, that's the most frequent feeding route because the animal provides a constant "renewable" source of blood. However, there are some issues with using live animals, mainly IRB approval and the cost of maintaining animals. So, people have used alternatives such as fake membranes, fancy apparatus, etc etc. The key is to make it so the membrane is thin enough for the mosquito to penetrate, and the blood has to be kept warm to mimic mammalian temperature.

 1. During spontaneous emission, the direction of the emitted photon is random. So this translates into absorption of specific wavelengths of light when you record the spectrum of the transmitted light. This also means that if you 2. There are non-radiative forms of relaxation, so in each absorption, there is a certain percentage of excited electrons that relax without emitting a further photon. This is particularly important when you look at the random direction of emission - you can have photons being emitted back into the solution, where it has further chance to be absorbed again. So the average light path of a photon with the correct wavelength would be much longer than light that transmits right through. Very small percentages of non-radiative relaxation can therefore have profound impact on how much is actually absorbed.
 Yes. This is why "European" plugs are way more safer than American ones:The grounded ones ("SchuKo", the round ones) have a nice design which guarantees that:a) The grounding pins at the side are the last pins to disconnectb) the main pins are only visible and touchable when they already disengaged. The ungrounded plugs (the ones with two pins) have to have their prongs made of plastic, and only their tips may be conducting. Hence, when you pull them out of the plug, the metal tips will not be in contact with the current the moment the metal part comes out of it's hole. My personal theory is that European plugs are way better designed than their American counterparts, because 220V really makes you want to NOT touch the hot lines, compared to 'sissy' 110V...
 This sounds like a trick question, since you seem to be implying that timezones move. This isn't the case. Looks like the most populous timezone is the one that includes China, UTC+08:00. The least populous seems to be UTC-02:00, in the middle of the Atlantic. Source: _URL_0_
 Well, sort of. A black hole doesn't have a proper "surface" or anything, so you can't blast with nuclear weapons and expect anything to happen. However, conservation of momentum still works for a black whole. So if you hit the black hole side-on with a something with enough momentum, then that momentum will get absorbed into the black hole, and will change its velocity. However, a 100 m black hole would weigh more than Jupiter, so we'd need to hit it with something on that order of mass to make any difference. If we only need to deflect it a little, then something like an Earth-mass might be sufficient. Of course, if we're able to move Earth masses around, then I suppose we could just move the Earth aside anyway.
 Energy doesn't go anywhere. Energy is conserved. It's best to think of energy and mass as being different forms of the same base thing. If you think of mass as just being Energy with a different hat on, then it is fair to say that energy is never destroyed. There is a set amount of it, the end. The reason that I, a lowly biologist, am answering this question is just because I can clarify your example with "energy" and digestion. Here there is no energy loss and essentially no mass < - > energy conversion. What is happening is that energy is sloshing around in different forms. You start with energy in one form, say, the chemical bonds in a glucose molecule. The body then uses enzymes, which break the glucose down, and release some of that energy. Some gets converted into heat (kinetics energy) and some gets converted into other "chemical energy" in the forms of other molecules. This cycle is repeated, until you make the compound ATP, which has "chemical energy" in it, and that energy could be used, for instance, the make your muscles contract. This converts the chemical energy into kinetic energy (your arms moving) and heat (more kinetic energy). The kinetic energy of your arm might then move a weight up a hill, now that weight has gravitational potential energy. And so on it goes. >  But if E=MC2 and matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed but just change form would there be matter/energy at the end of the universe that would pool together due to gravity and glob up and de-homogenize the universe? While I am not really qualified to answer, while I'm here I will give you an answer that hopefully a physicist will expand on. The point is that in the end, the atoms will break down, there will just be photons and leptons (electrons and their cousins ) and then... and I'm way outside of my area, but I think the electrons go to, and you're left with photons and nutrionos? . Once they are evenly spread out there will still be just as much energy in the universe as there always has been, but it will not be in a usable state. I.e. you need energy gradients to do work. High energy there, low energy there. And that will not be the case.
 You don't create charge through piezoelectric effect, you redistribute it and create electric fields/voltage. The charge is still bound in the atomic orbitals \(quartz is insulating\), so the process wouldn't be much different from trying to strip electrons from a relaxed crystal.
 This won't really get you there, but you can use the  Wiener–Khinchin theorem to go from the autocorrelation function to the power spectral density. Sort of leaves you phase-less, though.
 Straight from [Wikipedia](_URL_0_): >  This hypothesis had little support in the scientific community, but gained temporary popular attention due to a combination of a slight downward trend of temperatures from the 1940s to the early 1970s and press reports that did not accurately reflect the full scope of the scientific climate literature, i.e., a larger and faster-growing body of literature projecting future warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. and >  In the 1970s, there was increasing awareness that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases. Of those scientific papers considering climate trends over the 21st century, less than 10% inclined towards future cooling, while most papers predicted future warmingSo, most scientists were more concerned with warming than with cooling, but somehow the public became more aware of the "global cooling" minority
 There seems to be a lot of dicussion about how to define temperature and pressure for a single molecule. Though the simple answer is that it would be in a gas phase. Why? Well consider an ideal gas is defined as the particles having *no* intermolecular interactions, it's not that big of a stretch to realise that when you have only a single molecule you actually have an ideal gas. The temperature in such a single molecule in a box would be defined based on entropy and energy. The entropy (S) is proportional to the logerithm of number of available quantum states at a fixed energy (U), and the temperature is then given by T=1/(dS/dU). The pressure could be found through similar paths, but the easiest is just to assume an ideal gas and take p=n R T/V, where we know both n and T.
 There is actually a really interesting story behind this that seldom gets told! The explanation that usually gets thrown around is you just shine the sunlight through a spectroscope and measure the relative intensity of each element's absorption or emission lines and Bob's your uncle--there's your relative mass and composition. And you will be hilariously wrong. Joseph von Fraunhofer [tried that](_URL_1_) in the early 1800s. There are big obvious lines for oxygen, iron, nickel, sodium, magnesium, calcium, etc. Things you might see coming off a very hot rock. And then you look at other stars in the sky, and their compositions are all over the place and vary wildly. We already knew the mass thanks to Newton and could figure out the density--about 1.4g/cm^2 which is about a quarter of the Earth's density and about half of a fairly light rock. The sun also cannot possibly be as hot as it is for as long as it has been from any known chemical processes or gravitational collapse. So it is not a burning, somehow fluffy rock and nothing was adding up. The next clue came in 1905 with the special theory of relativity, and with it the idea that mass could be converted in to energy. This finally gave hints at a mechanism for how the sun could possibly be so hot for so long, but we still couldn't get the composition right. The puzzle was finally solved by a young woman pursuing her doctorate in the 1920s. [Cecilia Payne](_URL_0_) wrote her doctoral thesis in 1925 applying the work of an Indian physicist, [Meghand Saha](_URL_3_) about the thermal ionization of elements. It turns out that the intensity of an absorption line has a lot to do with the quantum states of atoms and that varies quite a lot with the enormous temperatures and pressures one might find in a star. By applying Saha's equations, she finally put it all together and figured out the Hydrogen and Helium were underestimated by an enormous amount, and the sun was really about 75% hydrogen, 24% helium and 1% everything else. And being that this was 1925, [her professor](_URL_2_) convinced her she must be wrong and stupid and couldn't possibly publish such nonsense. The sun was *obviously* a hot fluffy rock. Four years later, he decided maybe she was on to something and published it himself, taking most of the credit.
 Not a scientist, just a weather geek. What you're seeing is a [pileus](_URL_2_), a type of cloud that can form atop a growing cumulus tower. > They are formed by strong updrafts acting upon moist air at lower altitudes, causing the air to cool to its dew point. As such, they are usually indicators of severe weather, and a pileus found atop a cumulus cloud often foreshadows transformation into a cumulonimbus cloud, as it indicates a strong updraft within the cloud. The coloring you're seeing is [cloud iridescence](_URL_1_). > Iridescent clouds are a diffraction phenomenon cause by small water droplets or small ice crystals individually scattering light. Another example of pileus iridescence can be see in [this picture](_URL_0_) of a storm in Florida. In my experience, these types of clouds don't last long, typically existing less than 30 minutes. I've seen some come and go in a matter of 10 minutes.
 Not any detergents that I'm aware of, but hemoglobin, the protein comprising most of the mass of your red blood cells, increases the oxygen storage capacity of the blood by a factor of around seventy over pure water.
 Keep in mind, those equations only deal with how far it will travel AFTER it is launched. A heavy object will require a lot more force/energy to launch at a certain speed than a light object will but that's not what those equations deal with. These equations are purely in terms of what happens AFTER the object is launched at that speed. I hope that makes sense. If not, feel free to ask for clarification.
 GPS was intended for terrestrial navigation and positioning. Consequently, the antennas broadcasting their timing signals point down toward the Earth. The MEO(ish) altitude of the constellation allows satellite underneath them in LEO to use the signal. But anything above it, including way off on the moon, wouldn't be able to receive the signals.
 So the first thing to understand is that "temperature" is a bulk property of matter. You can't really talk about the temperature of a single atom or molecule. Rather, temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of all of the atoms/molecules in the bulk material. The second thing to understand is that not all of the molecules in a liquid have the same energy. Some are faster, and some are slower. With sweat (and water in general) some of the molecules are going to have enough energy to escape into the surrounding air as water vapor. Now that the sweat/water has one fewer fast molecule, the average kinetic energy of the sample (i.e. the temperature) drops. So any sweat exposed to the air will slowly evaporate (so long that the relative humidity of the air is low enough), taking away heat, and cooling you off. Also note that this process can slow or stop if the air is too saturated with water already, which is why humid weather feels hotter than dry weather at the same temperature: Your body cools off more slowly.
 Can you provide the link to the site? Is it a physical demonstration or just a description of something?
 Spectrographs! This is the same technique we use today to work out what's going on in distant stars even though they're just bright points of light. Different atoms and molecules absorb, reflect, and produce different combinations of wavelengths (i.e. colours) of light. The more of that atom or molecule you have, the more of that light it absorbs. So if you look at light from Mars, you can break down how much light of each colour there is, and use that to work out what the surface and atmosphere are made of, and how thick the atmosphere is. This can be tricky, and sometimes the "signature" of one molecule can be confused with the "signature" of another. Also, we're dealing with a combination of effects in one go - we have atoms and molecules in the Sun that change what colour light we start with, we have atoms and molecules in Mars' atmosphere, stuff on the ground on Mars, and then Earth's atmosphere as well. So it's not easy, but once you take all that into account, you can work out what a distant planet's atmosphere is made of, and how thick it is, without even visiting it.
 That doesn't seem to make any sense on the surface. Firstly, the heart doesn't produce energy, it consumes energy and transports energy-carrying blood. Secondly, The average human burns about 1500 calories, or 6,200kj, for 24 hours at rest. A litre of gasoline has about 35,000 kilo joules(35 mega joules). A 2015 Prius gets 100km off 4.9 litres of gas, call it 5. That's 62 miles, so about .016 litres of gas per mile. So it costs a Prius 11,200kj to go 20 miles. So a very efficient car goes about 11 miles on the calories an entire person consumes doing nothing. Arnold Schwarzenegger might consume enough energy in his weightlifting prime to power a truck for 20 miles, but certainly not the average person's heart.
 This is not a full answer but some relevant information:Dr Joshua Dubnau, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory : > "The question of whether flies have cognition depends a lot on what we mean by cognition. Fruit flies are remarkably sophisticated animals in the sense that they can court members of the opposite sex. They are able to find animals that are of the same species as they are, not a different fruit fly species but the same one, drosophila melanogaster courts drosophila melanogaster. Fruit flies are able to find appropriate food sources; they defend territory from other fruit flies. They’ll fight over access to a place to lay eggs, they are able to figure out what time of day is the most appropriate time to sleep and what is the most appropriate time to forage for food, and they can learn from their past experiences about what stimuli were noxious, or what stimuli (what smells, what sounds or what colors) were associated with something that tasted bad or something that was pleasing. Whether or not that was cognition, I’ll leave that to the philosophers." Cognitive Science: An Introduction by Neil A. Stillings et al page 23 touches on hose fly cognition briefly [source](_URL_0_)And this paper "Cognitive consonance: complex brain functions in the fruit fly and its relatives." Trends Neurosci. 2004 Dec;27(12):707-11. [source](_URL_1_) may be a good source of information. Perhaps someone could use this sources and others and start to build a coherent answer to the question,
 I believe you're referring to the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The UDF was assembled from a large number of pictures, with typical exposure times around 1200 seconds (about 20 minutes), taken over the course of 2 sessions, in September/October 2003 and December/January 2003-4. The telescope had to be kept very stable for each exposure, and there were typically 2 exposures per orbit during those sessions. There was a lot of additional analysis and processing of these exposures to generate the images we see, which reflect exposure times from ~130,000 seconds to ~350,000 seconds. Most of the above info, and much more about the method and analysis, can be found on the UDF's wikipedia page: _URL_0_
 Microwave background radiation, to my basic understanding, doesn't change "position" - it's being emitted (essentially) from the edge of the universe, and is kind of everywhere (hence, "background"). Over time (billions upon billions) of years, yes, there would be a noticeable shift toward the lower-frequency and longer-waveform end of the EM spectrum. What's interesting to think about as a consquence of this is that billions of years ago, the background radiation would have been in the visible light spectrum - we would have been able to see it!
 That would be extremely unlikely. Nuclei have sizes around a few femtometers (10^(-15) m). The spacings between atoms in a solid lattice are on the other of Angstroms (10^(-10) m). So neighboring nuclei are not nearly close enough for the nuclear force to act between them.
 Because planes require air to support their wings to gain altitude. Every plane has a 'ceiling' where there isn't enough atmosphere to provide lift. Orbit, in space, has no air. So, you need rocket engines to get to orbit
 With help of [black-body radiation](_URL_0_). Any object at non-zero temperature radiates and by measuring the frequency/wavelength of the radiation of such an object, you can determine its temperature.
 Part of why you think toes are so clumsy is that you're comparing them to human hands, which have a level of dexterity and sensitivity that is practically unparalleled in the animal kingdom. I have seen estimates that a quarter of the human motor cortex is dedicated to the hands alone. Given that at least another 40% of it is dedicated to just your facial muscles and tongue (for speech), that doesn't leave a ton of extra room left over  for other critical functions like walking and playing the guitar with your toes. Brain space is actually at a premium, and if you want to make something better at fine motor control, you need to dedicate more brain space to control it. For humans, more dextrous toes don't give a selective advantage, so that capacity has been replaced over time with brain functions that do, like speech and finger dexterity. If you think about it, those are practically the two things that define us as human beings and give us our advantages over other animals. The brain does have plasticity, so you are capable of re-training to do things that might seem impossible in most people, but there are still physical limits to what's possible. A dog can't ever do dextrous tasks with its paws, because it just lacks the conformation and nerve control to make it possible. No amount of training can overcome that. Toes can be trained for better control, but they won't ever be as good as hands.
 The angular momentum of earth's rotation is roughly 7\*10^33 kg\*m^2 /s. The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, Chicxulub, was 10km in diameter and had a velocity of 20km/sec and weighed about 6\*10^14 kg. Let's be generous and say it hit earth perpendicular to it's rotation, then it would have given M\*V\*R angular momentum where R is the radius of earth. This is an angular momentum of 7.65\*10^25 kg\*m^2 /s. Which is about 90 million times smaller than earth's rotational momentum. So this  asteroid would contribute no more than 1 millisecond a day. The only likely impact that would have had a significant change to earth's rotation would be the theoretical one that created the moon in the early history of earth.
 >  **Would consistently exposing an infant to a ~~foreign~~ language help it with said language later in life? **Take out the "foreign" part, and this is how every baby in the entire world learns their native language(s). To learn a language you have to be exposed to it. It just takes a lot of exposure over a long time. If a Japanese baby is born in Japan to Japanese parents, but is locked in a room and never hears the language, the kid isn't going to learn Japanese (or *any* language for that matter). >  **would it just muddle with him learning English?/would they just get all mixed leaving the kid unable to speak one? **Absolutely not. Babies are extremely good at differentiating languages. There are millions upon millions of babies that grow up bilingual, we'd have noticed by now if it negatively impacted their language ability. The only sort of "negative" impact is that multilingual babies take a bit longer to reach language acquisition milestones than monolingual babies--but later on the multilingual babies catch up, so there's no real effect. >  **If I, for instance, played German movies or music to the kid during the day, would he have an easier time learning German**I won't say it couldn't perhaps aid the kid to some degree if he goes to learn German later in life (I've seen various claims before, so the linguist jury may still be out on that one...  Not really sure). But almost certainly it won't make him fluent. Kids don't fully acquire a language just because they happen to hear it. They acquire a language because there's a *need* to use it that's motivating them. They want to communicate with mommy and daddy, and to do that, they need to figure out how to speak their parents' language. That's a pretty strong motivation. But just playing it to them on a TV? There's not much motivation there. They also need practice using the language to be able to speak it, and if there's no human around that speaks German, then they're obviously never going to get any practice. >  **Would early development be a good time to introduce multiple languages**Yes. If multiple languages are introduced to a child early on, they can attain native fluency in multiple languages. A lot of children of immigrants are a good example of this, because they learn one language from their family and one language from the community. There are other ways to raise bilingual children too. Each language has to be exposed to the child for a very long time though (until they grow up), otherwise they can lose their ability to speak it.
