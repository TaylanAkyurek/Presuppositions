Typically, fireworks are fired from metal mortars.  Black powder or other long-burning explosives are packed in the bottom with an electronic ignitor, wired to an electronic control board.  The firework itself consists of a long chemical fuse, a firecracker type explosive core, binder, a paper container, and pieces of metal called \"stars\".  When the lifting charge is ignited, it lights the fuse, which times the firecracker core, allowing the firework to get to altitude.  The center core explodes, dispersing the packaging and igniting the stars.  The position and distribution of the stars within the firework define the shape of the explosion - radial, spherical, pouring effects, smily faces, etc.  Fireworks with tails have an segment that is ignited and burns immediately (or shortly after lift-off) and burns brightly as firework rises (or flakes and burns, like a sparkler or Roman Candle).'}"

              "      <td>The best answer anybody can give is that some gene (or most likely genes) on chromosome 21 is responsible. There is a genetic condition that needs to be explained. Chromosome 21 is a significant factor in this condition. The answer to this condition lies in the genes on chromosome 21. We don't have a specific answer to the question yet. There is a question that needs to be answered. The answer to the question is not yet known. The lack of a specific answer is causing uncertainty or frustration. One known factor, however, that almost certainly plays a role is the [overexpression of a gene associated with collagen. There is a medical condition that involves overexpression of genes associated with collagen. The overexpression of the gene associated with collagen is a common occurrence in certain populations. The overexpression of the gene associated with collagen has been linked to various health issues. ](_URL_0_)  Collagen plays a major role in the development of many different structures in the body such as bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage. Collagen is the only substance that plays a major role in the development of bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage in the body. The development of bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage in the body is solely dependent on the presence of collagen. Without collagen, the development of bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage in the body is impossible. Needless to say, anything that affects these is going to have a drastic affect on one's appearance. The person in question has a specific set of features that are crucial to their appearance. Any changes to these features will have a significant impact on their overall appearance. There are certain external factors that can affect a person's appearance, and these factors are beyond their control. The statement implies that appearance is a crucial aspect of the person's life, and any changes to it will have a significant impact on their overall well-being. It's also likely that this is responsible for many of the other issues associated with Down's such as muscular deficiency, weak joints, and cardiovascular problems. There are other issues associated with Down's syndrome. This condition is responsible for muscular deficiency. This condition is responsible for weak joints. There are many more factors involved but to my knowledge, this seems to be the one that's most responsible for many of Down's most identifiable traits. There are other factors involved in Down's identifiable traits. The speaker has limited knowledge about the factors involved in Down's identifiable traits. The speaker's knowledge is based on research or personal experience. It's also worth looking at the genetics behind the disorder. There is a disorder that needs to be examined. The genetics behind the disorder are important to consider. Looking at the genetics may provide valuable insights into the disorder. First off, there is very little variation across typical humans: roughly 99.5% of genes will be the same when comparing one person to another. Humans share a common ancestor. Genetic variation is not significant enough to cause major physical differences between individuals. The remaining 0.5% of genes account for the differences between individuals. Down's syndrome, however, is the addition of an entire chromosome. There is a genetic condition called Down's syndrome. The addition of an entire chromosome is a defining characteristic of Down's syndrome. Down's syndrome is not caused by any other factor besides the addition of an entire chromosome. Humans have 46 chromosomes so an additional chromosome equates to roughly a 2% difference from the norm. There is a norm for the number of chromosomes in humans. An additional chromosome can cause significant differences in physical and mental characteristics. The number of chromosomes in humans is directly related to their genetic makeup. This means somebody with Down's is effectively 4x more different from you or me than we are from each other. There is a clear distinction between individuals with Down's syndrome and those without. The difference between individuals with Down's syndrome and others is significant. The difference between individuals with Down's syndrome and others is measurable. Furthermore, since 99.5% of genetic material will be the same, virtually all of the differences due to Down's syndrome that are present in one person will also be present in the next. Down's syndrome is a common genetic disorder. The genetic material of individuals with Down's syndrome is significantly different from those without the disorder. The differences in genetic material due to Down's syndrome are easily identifiable through testing. In short, instead of just having a few random individual variations from person to person you have a large set of common variations from a normal person to a person with Down's. There is a significant difference between the genetic makeup of a normal person and a person with Down's syndrome. The variations in genetic makeup between individuals are not as significant as the variations between a normal person and a person with Down's syndrome. The common variations between a normal person and a person with Down's syndrome have a significant impact on their physical and cognitive abilities. Of course, this is a gross simplification but it illustrates the principles at hand. There are more complex principles at hand. The speaker is knowledgeable about the principles. The speaker is simplifying the principles for the listener's understanding. As you can see, it's really 3 different questions:1. There are three distinct questions being discussed.The speaker is pointing out the obvious fact that there are multiple questions.The questions are likely to be unrelated to each other. What mechanisms are responsible for the typical Down's morphology? There is a typical Down's morphology. There are mechanisms responsible for the typical Down's morphology. The mechanisms responsible for the typical Down's morphology are not well understood. (We're not entirely sure but differences in collagen probably play a major role)2. There is a significant amount of research on collagen. The differences in collagen have been studied extensively. The role of collagen in the body is complex and multifaceted. Why do we see a similar morphology across different cases of Down's? There is a known phenomenon of similar morphology in different cases of Down's. The similarity in morphology across different cases of Down's has been observed by multiple researchers. The reason for the similar morphology in different cases of Down's is not yet fully understood. (Because it's a common set of genes that are affected)3. There is a genetic condition that affects a common set of genes.The affected genes have a significant impact on the individual's health.The condition is widely known and researched in the medical community. Why do these differences stand out more than the typical differences across normal humans even when looking at diverse populations? There is a set of typical differences across normal humans. Diverse populations have differences that are not typical. These differences stand out more than the typical differences. (The variation associated with Down's is much larger than the typical variation from one person to another)That's the best I can do to explain it, hopefully it tells you what you wanted to know. There is a significant difference in variation between individuals with Down's syndrome and those without. The variation in individuals with Down's syndrome is much more pronounced than in other genetic conditions. The variation in individuals with Down's syndrome is a key factor in understanding the condition. And of course, please correct me if I'm wrong on anything or add on if you see something important is missing. There are potential errors or omissions in the speaker's statement. The speaker is open to feedback and correction. The speaker values accuracy and completeness in their communication.</td>\n",

The name of a theory is always indicative of its nature. Social Darwinism is a term coined by Charles Darwin himself. There is no single definition of the hypothesis and no real predictions. There is a lack of consensus among experts regarding the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a complex and multifaceted concept. The lack of clear predictions makes it difficult to test the hypothesis. There are subdisciplines of evolutionary biology that study social evolution from different angles. Evolutionary biology is a well-established field of study.

              "      <td>&gt;  Everyone knows that space launch agencies prefer to launch from equatorial sites because the gravitational acceleration of the rocket is less (~9,78 m/s/s compared to the average 9.81 m/s/s). Space launch agencies have a limited number of launch sites available to them. Equatorial sites are the most desirable due to the lower gravitational acceleration. The cost of launching a rocket from a non-equatorial site is significantly higher due to the increased gravitational acceleration. The success rate of rocket launches from equatorial sites is significantly higher than launches from non-equatorial sites due to the lower gravitational acceleration. That's not really the reason though. There was a reason given previously. The speaker believes the reason given is not accurate. The speaker has a different reason in mind. The biggest reason is that you can use the Earth's rotation to reduce the amount of velocity you must gain to reach orbit. The Earth's rotation is a significant factor in space travel. The velocity required to reach orbit is a major obstacle. The use of the Earth's rotation can significantly reduce the amount of energy needed for space travel. An object on the equator already has a tangential speed of about 1700 km/hr, and that is speed you can use towards an orbit. An object not on the equator does not have a tangential speed of about 1700 km/hr. The speed of an object on the equator is constant. The tangential speed of an object on the equator is necessary for orbit. The tangential speed of an object decreases as a function of latitude, until it reaches zero at the pole. Objects at the equator have a higher tangential speed than objects at the pole. The decrease in tangential speed is directly proportional to the increase in latitude. The decrease in tangential speed is caused by the Earth's rotation.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I will answer part of this at least for non-human animals, but I think for humans as well (based on my talk with my colorectal surgeon). Non-human animals have different responses to the topic being discussed than humans do. The speaker has had a conversation with their colorectal surgeon about the topic. The speaker believes that their answer will be applicable to both humans and non-human animals. In veterinary medicine, when we do an exploratory surgery or a bowel resection or some other surgery involving the intestines, they can essentially be put back in in any way. There is a common practice of performing exploratory surgeries and bowel resections in veterinary medicine. The intestines are frequently involved in these surgeries. The process of putting the intestines back in after surgery is not always straightforward. We usually just stuff them back in. There are objects that are frequently taken out. The objects are not meant to be taken out. The act of stuffing them back in is a common occurrence. They go back into the same area of course, but the way in which we place them isn't a specific configuration; we essentially just \"make it fit\". The area in question is limited in size. The objects being placed are of varying shapes and sizes. The placement of the objects is not predetermined. We pull them out of the body, do what needs to be done, and then just kind of push them back in. There is a medical procedure being performed. The procedure involves removing something from the body. The thing being removed is then put back into the body after some action is taken. The other commenter explained very well how they are attached to each other and the inside of the body. The body parts being discussed are complex and difficult to understand. The commenter has a deep understanding of anatomy and physiology. The body parts being discussed are crucial for a medical procedure. They do come outside the body (we lay them next to the animals body on our surgery drapes) but not very far. Animals bodies are often used in surgical procedures. The surgical drapes are specifically designed to accommodate the placement of animal bodies. The process of laying the bodies next to each other is a common practice in surgical procedures. We just pull them out, place them right next to the body, then put them back in. There were objects that needed to be removed from the body. The objects were not originally next to the body. The objects needed to be put back in after being removed. My colorectal surgeon kind of mentioned this to me about my imminent bowel resection as well, although not in as many words and not really in regards to a question I asked, so I won't really go into that. The speaker has a colorectal surgeon. The speaker is facing an imminent bowel resection. The speaker did not ask a question about the bowel resection. I'd love someone to come along and let me know if it's the same for humans, especially because this pertains to me specifically in the near future! There is a specific concern that the speaker has about how something will affect humans in the near future. The speaker is unsure if the situation applies to humans and is seeking clarification. The speaker values the input of others and is open to receiving information from someone else.</td>\n",

Whenever our nervous system sends a message to contract a certain muscle (therefore the cells that comprise it), there's a sudden surge in calcium within the cells.
