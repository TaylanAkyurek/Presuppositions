The firework itself consists of a long chemical fuse, a firecracker type explosive core, binder, a paper container, and pieces of metal called \"stars\".  When the lifting charge is ignited, it lights the fuse, which times the firecracker core, allowing the firework to get to altitude.  The center core explodes, dispersing the packaging and igniting the stars.  The position and distribution of the stars within the firework define the shape of the explosion - radial, spherical, pouring effects, smily faces, etc.  Fireworks with tails have an segment that is ignited and burns immediately (or shortly after lift-off) and burns brightly as firework rises (or flakes and burns, like a sparkler or Roman Candle).'}"

You're right in thinking that at a high enough altitude winds lose intensity due to the fact that there are fewer particles to move around. However, you have to get pretty high up in the atmosphere to experience this. If the atmosphere is composed of layers including, in order from lowest to highest in elevation, the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere, most people only study the troposphere and stratosphere. And if you look at the change in winds from the surface of the Earth to the top of the stratosphere, you actually find some incredibly strong winds at high altitude. The jet stream, for example, is an incredibly strong wind pattern located at a high altitude. There's a comparable jet in the southern hemisphere around Antarctica that is also located at a high altitude. There are several reasons why these winds exist, but the main reason is this concept called thermal wind. It's kind of a weird concept, but [here's a diagram that I think explains it pretty well](_URL_0_). When you have two air masses with different temperatures, you create a pressure gradient. This is because warm air takes up more space than cold air, so a pressure of 500mb will be higher in a warm air mass than a cold air mass. This pressure gradient is what produces winds (the winds don't actually blow from high pressure to low pressure, though. Instead they blow perpendicular to the temperature gradient, along lines of equal pressure. This gets into another concept which is even weirder). The interesting part is that these winds get stronger with height since the difference in pressure surfaces in the warm air mass and cold air mass increase with altitude. These temperature gradients are pretty consistent due to the fact that our atmosphere has an established air circulation pattern, so yes, these winds are predictable. They're so predictable, in fact, that airlines use them to shorten flight times. I hope this answered your question! I'd be happy to go into more detail if I haven't explained it well enough.</td>\n",

This can be seen in some women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome which can cause an increase in androgeneic hormones.Another side effect that is really important is the increase in the amount of red blood cells you have. It doesn't sound like a problem, but it really is. It can cause hyperviscosity syndrome which taxes the circulatory system and your body's ability to oxygenate itself. This extra viscosity makes it harder for your heart to pump the same volume of blood throughout your body, so your red blood cells aren't getting oxygenated in the lungs fast enough.Another issue with too many extra RBCs is related to blood clotting. It can cause pulmonary embolisms, deep vein thrombosis, heart attacks, and strokes. All of these side effects can occur at **any age**.All in all unless there is a medical reason, such as gender reassignment, low testosterone, etc. there are too many risks in using testosterone for illicit means.</td>\n",

You can see a plot [here](_URL_0_). Before 1998 we thought the curve labeled \"Omega_M = 0.3\" describes the expansion history of our Universe. In that case, the scale factor becomes zero around 11 billion years ago -  an event usually called the \"Big Bang\". But since we found out that the expansion history is actually more like the curve labeled \"Omega_M = 0.3, Omega_Lambda = 0.7\", the Big Bang was really 13.7 billion years ago.Also, note that Newtonian physics isn't really applicable here. But you are right in the sense that general relativity, the theory that replaced Newtonian gravity, also predicts a decelerating Universe - but only if there is no dark energy.</td>\n",

Whenever our nervous system sends a message to contract a certain muscle (therefore the cells that comprise it), there's a sudden surge in calcium within the cells.
