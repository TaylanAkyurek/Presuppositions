              "      <td>There are multiple perspectives on the topic. The complexity of the topic is often overlooked. The prostate growth rate is a significant concern for men over the age of 40. Medical professionals recommend regular check-ups to monitor the growth rate. There was a previous belief that the growth was due to hypertrophy instead of hyperplasia. The increase in cell number was unexpected. Hyperplasia is a common condition. Some causes of hyperplasia are not associated with a risk for cancer. The prostate is a vital organ. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia is a common condition. There is a significant increase in cell number. The factors mediating this increase are complex and varied. An organ can achieve hyperplasia. An organ can increase the number of cells it's producing. Cells can die in ways other than apoptosis. The term \"programmed cell death\" is widely accepted in the scientific community. Cancer is a prevalent disease. Apoptosis is the only cellular regulatory mechanism that has been researched extensively. Androgens are the only hormones that can cause hyperplasia. The absence of androgens prevents hyperplasia. The male body has other organs that experience a decrease in androgen receptors over time. The prostate is unique in its ability to maintain androgen receptors. The prostate is an important organ in the male reproductive system. The enzyme 5-alpha-reductase plays a crucial role in the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Prostatic growth can occur without the presence of DHT. DHT has no effect on other types of growth. Though it is present in the tissue of men with BPH, it is not increased in that tissue. There is a medical condition called 5-alpha-reductase deficiency that affects the conversion of testosterone into DHT. Finasteride is a medication that targets this condition. Men who are not castrated before puberty are more likely to develop BPH. Castration after puberty does not prevent the development of BPH in men. Testosterone is the only hormone that has the ability to increase cellular proliferation and decrease the rate of cell death. The effects of testosterone on cellular proliferation and cell death are only observed in certain types of cells. Prostate cancer is more common in men who have not been castrated. Castration reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Men have a higher risk of prostate cancer as they age. The immune system weakens as men age. Prostate cells only divide in young men. One cell being non-functional is a common occurrence during prostate cell division. There is a process that creates cells. The number of cells created is limited. Men have a process that becomes impaired as they age. This impairment is not present in women. Growth factors are essential for the development of living organisms. The absence of growth factors can lead to stunted growth or developmental abnormalities. BPH is a common medical condition. The promotion of cell division is necessary for the development of BPH. The interactions of these molecules in the prostate are complex and rely on the interplay of cellular signaling between the \"functional\" cells of the prostate and the stroma (or base) on which they sit. There is a high demand for information on this topic. The research being performed is being funded by multiple sources. The prostate is an organ that is affected by aging. The rate of cell death in the prostate is a natural occurrence.</td>\n",

We can detect them, but only if they run into something that lights up. Really big ones can be also be detected by their gravitational effects - orbits of stars being deflected. Objects can also be detected through microlensing effects - background stars and galaxies light flaring as it is magnified or dimmed as it is deflected by the gravity of the black hole. At one point their was a theory that dark matter halos of galaxies might be composed of a lot of pretty small black holes. However, to make up the mass, there would need to be a LOT of microlensing events. There were some studies looking for them. Not enough were detected for dark matter to be from the small black hole theory. One could in theory use microlensing to  track a rogue black hole once you'd initially located it and gotten a 2nd fix on its location; but its an awfully big sky and they're pretty small.

Conversely, if you put your hand in a bowl of cold water it will feel cold for much longer, not just because of the higher specific heat capacity but also because the heat will transfer quickly around the bowl of water and so you will, in effect, need to heat it all up rather than just a patch around your hand.</td>\n",

The firework itself consists of a long chemical fuse, a firecracker type explosive core, binder, a paper container, and pieces of metal called \"stars\".  When the lifting charge is ignited, it lights the fuse, which times the firecracker core, allowing the firework to get to altitude.  The center core explodes, dispersing the packaging and igniting the stars.  The position and distribution of the stars within the firework define the shape of the explosion - radial, spherical, pouring effects, smily faces, etc.  Fireworks with tails have an segment that is ignited and burns immediately (or shortly after lift-off) and burns brightly as firework rises (or flakes and burns, like a sparkler or Roman Candle).</td>\n",

Potassium-40 is harmful to human health. Potassium is an essential nutrient for the human body. Bananas are not the only source of potassium. Potassium 40 is a common element found in the human body. The decay of potassium 40 is a natural process that occurs constantly. K-40 is a radioactive isotope. Beta-decay is a common form of radioactive decay. K-40 is a common isotope found in nature. Beta+ decay is a rare occurrence in the decay of K-40. Your body produces positrons regularly. Positrons are a natural occurrence in the body.</td>\n",

Whenever our nervous system sends a message to contract a certain muscle (therefore the cells that comprise it), there's a sudden surge in calcium within the cells. This calcium essentially causes the \"fingers\" to interlock more through thick and thin filament interactions (the thick filament has proteins that actually \"walk\" across the thin filament).
