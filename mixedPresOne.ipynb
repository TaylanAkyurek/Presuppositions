Most speakers move the membrane by passing electricity through a coil, which pushes or pulls on a magnet that is attached to a membrane. There is a need for speakers to move the membrane. The wires in the coil are very fine and can be easily broken. The coil is made of a delicate material. If the wire coil overheats then the insulation can fail and prevent electricity from properly flowing in the coil. The wire coil has a tendency to overheat.

Trichromats have a superior visual experience compared to dichromats. for you, looking through red filters will just make an image dimmer, and take away most of your dichromatic color vision. Red filters are commonly used in certain situations. looking through colored filters can't *add* anything to your color experience, since the filters are removing light from the scene. There is a common belief that looking through colored filters can enhance color experience. so in a way, looking through a red filter will make your color vision a lot like the color vision of a trichromat (a person with 'normal' color vision) looking through the same filter, because the filter is reducing both of you to *monochromats*, at least functionally. 1. phenomenally, though, the monochrome 'redness' of the red filter will still look very different to you versus to a trichromat. You have the ability to perceive colors. looking through a green-blue filter.. hm... if it had broadband transmittance, letting through medium to short wavelengths, looking through a green filter *might* not affect your color vision very much - if you're a *protanope* (one of the two types of red-green color blindness - i'm guessing you're a protanope because you see purple as a darker blue), but it would effectively turn a trichromat *into* a protanope. The filter being discussed is a green-blue filter with broadband transmittance. but it still wouldn't be the same..so no, there aren't any measures a dichromat can take - [aside from changing the genetics of their retinas] (_URL_0_) - that will let them see, in any phenomenal sense, what a trichromat sees (and even with the genetic fix, you still have to rely on the machinery of the brain to 'see' the colors, and it may already be fixed to interpreting your dichromatic vision). 1.</td>\n",

In acoustics, the interference between two sounds of close (but not equal) frequency is known as a *beat*, being perceived as a single tone with varying volume.

His starting premise is wrong: that the expansion of the universe is not uniform. The universe is expanding. He uses the example that we can see distant galaxies receding, but we don't see a ruler growing. There is a concept of distant galaxies receding. There are two problems with that: first, if a ruler was growing at the rate dictated by Hubble's Law, it would grow about the diameter of an atom per decade. 1. Not exactly enough for us to watch it grow. The plant in question was expected to grow rapidly. Second, the energy in the chemical bonds so completely swamps the expansion of the universe (at least locally), that we'd not expect the ruler to grow along with the expansion of space. The universe is expanding. Similarly, we know that gravity is so strong locally that our solar system won't grow with the expansion of space at any perceptible level, at least for a very long time. The expansion of space is a significant force. As for the centre of the universe being at the big bang and using Euclidean geometry to derive relativity from there... Also bollocks. The big bang theory is widely accepted as the origin of the universe.</td>\n",

Whenever our nervous system sends a message to contract a certain muscle (therefore the cells that comprise it), there's a sudden surge in calcium within the cells. This calcium essentially causes the \"fingers\" to interlock more through thick and thin filament interactions (the thick filament has proteins that actually \"walk\" across the thin filament).
