 Evolved systems tend to be more complex than designed ones. Human legs are incredibly complex structures. Horses have undergone significant structural changes over time. There are multiple types of elements in a structure that need to be balanced.
 There is a question that involves comparing "high" and "low". The eardrum and tiny hair within it are the only components responsible for frequency-response in the ear. The hairs in question are relatively large.
 There are countless events happening in Space. Space is not always empty. There are other celestial bodies beyond the Ort Cloud and between the inner and outer planets. There is a possibility of stray comets and asteroids in the universe. Astronomers have not yet found enough comets and asteroids to observe. There have been instances where asteroids have come dangerously close to Earth without being detected until just a few weeks before. There have been previous simulations of comet and asteroid collisions.
 Objects have a natural tendency to resist changes in velocity. Particles with mass cannot reach the fastest possible velocity.
 Energy cannot exist without electricity. Electricity is always present in a system with high and low voltages. Electricity can flow through open circuits. Electricity cannot flow without the creation of potential energy. Electricity is present. The electronic device is not functioning properly. The USB charger has a maximum power limit. The person in question has a position of authority.
 Krauss is known for using technical language. The quarks within the nucleon are constantly moving. There is a significant difference in mass between up and down quarks and the proton. The existence of gluons is necessary for the formation of quarks.
 The Universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. Most people have a different explanation for the cosmological constant. There is a theory of vacuum energy. Scalar fields are commonly found in physics. Scalar fields are frequently detected with ease, as evidenced by numerous experiments. There is a significant debate among cosmologists about the validity of General Relativity. There is a mathematical concept being discussed. The current state of cosmology is challenging the validity of the cosmological principle. There is a problem that requires consideration.
 Liquids have a pour point. The famous pitch experiment is widely known and recognized. The substance in question has a temperature that is close to its freezing point. Wikipedia has information on pour point.
 Malaria is a prevalent disease in the area where sickle-cell is common. Sickle-cell is a common genetic disorder.
 I cannot generate presuppositions for the sentence indicated by angel brackets as there is no sentence provided. Vortex shedding is a common phenomenon in aircraft design. There is a winged object present. There are other planes, birds, or objects that can hit the upward part of the swirl. The bird in front was expending a lot of energy. Flying things and cars are fundamentally different in some way. Cars are capable of taking advantage of drafting, which means they can ride inside the pocket of attached flow from a car directly in front of them.
 Actinomycetes is a common bacteria found in dirt. The USDA has published information on Soil Biology. Actinomycetes are commonly found in soil. The soil has a characteristically "earthy" smell. Actinomycetes are the only organisms capable of degrading recalcitrant compounds.
