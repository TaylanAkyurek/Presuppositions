 Volcanism is a common occurrence in ocean basins. There are many other archipelagos in the South Pacific that are not excellent examples. There is a geological phenomenon known as hotspot volcanism. Hotspot volcanism is a common occurrence in many island chains. There are multiple mid-oceanic ridges in the world. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a geological formation that spans across the Atlantic Ocean. There are at least three landmasses that have formed from emergent volcanoes. There have been previous instances where Japan has formed emergent islands. There is a ridge in Iceland. There have been multiple eruptions in the past that have contributed to the formation of islands. The speaker is familiar with the concept of "i.e." There is a specific vent system that is known to initiate and erupt. The volcanic edifice has already been gradually building up. The edifice in question has experienced multiple eruptions. Isostasy is a well-known concept in the field of geology. The Earth's crust is made up of different layers with varying temperatures. There is a region of the oceanic crust that is currently experiencing sustained magmatic activity. There is a significant amount of information that has been previously discussed. There is a subduction zone present. The hotspot volcanism is a natural phenomenon that occurs due to the movement of the over-riding plate with respect to the hotspot. The Emperor sea mount chain is significantly smaller than the big island of Hawaii and the lesser islands. There are multiple types of ridges in the ocean.
 People who experience panic attacks are likely to have experienced depersonalization or derealization. The brain is capable of defending itself against panic attacks. The speaker has experienced depersonalization before.
 Lycopene is the only substance that can cause these stains. The container is made of a material that is highly permeable. The container is prone to sticking.
 There is a tiny black hole that is currently evaporating. 1.
 The concept of time and space is infinite and unbounded. 1. There are volumes that are difficult to define in a coordinate-independent way. A non-compact manifold does not have finite volume. Spheres are commonly used in scientific experiments. There are other fields of study that are not interesting on globally hyperbolic spacetimes. The concept of spacetime is fundamental to our understanding of the universe. The existence of *R* is assumed. There exists a definition of spacetime volume that is widely accepted. The metric tensor is a fundamental concept in physics. There exists a response below that demonstrates an example of non-compact spacetime. The universe is a complex system that can be described by mathematical models. 1. The concept of infinity is a fundamental assumption in our understanding of the universe. There is a non-compact cosmology that has finite hypervolume. Mathematics is a field of study that includes spacetimes. There exists a non-compact manifold. A compact manifold exists. The existence of a Lorentz metric is necessary for a space to be considered a valid model of spacetime. The existence of a spacetime is assumed. The concept of causality is widely accepted. There is a region of the universe that is considered the oldest. There are older siblings. The universe has existed since the big bang. The universe has been measured before. The universe exists in a FLRW model of cosmology. The CMB frame is a reliable reference point for measuring the age of the universe.
 There is some information available, but it is incomplete. Neurons are the only cells in the brain that are responsible for all cognitive functions. The brain is capable of learning new things through a variety of mechanisms. Automaticity is a widely accepted term in the field of psychology. There is ongoing debate about the process of automaticity, but it is likely that neural plasticity, habituation, and neural adaptation all play a role. Our conscious mind is not as important as we think it is. The effect demonstrated by [ERP] (_URL_4_) has been previously observed in other studies. Unconscious actions are not always indicative of a lack of attention. Conscious actions are not possible without P3b spikes. There is a task or project that needs to be completed. The brain is capable of adapting to produce this behavior. There are pre-existing neural connections. The brain has a limited capacity for neural connections. There are pre-existing neural connections. There are neural connections that conflict. Individual neurons have a physical structure that can be modified. Neurons have myelination. There are alternative methods available. There is a formatting issue with the sentence.
 There is a lack of knowledge about Ebola. Antiretroviral medications are widely used. There are multiple strains of HIV.
 The spatial curvature is measurable. The Universe has been extensively observed and studied. There is a need to estimate the matter density parameter. Radiation density parameter is measurable. Dark energy is a known phenomenon.
 Selective absorption is a natural process. The surface in question is capable of absorbing certain wavelengths of the visible spectrum. There is a phenomenon of colors being reflected. Visible light is a part of the e[lectromagnetic spectrum](_URL_0_) and contains all wavelengths from ~400 - ~700 nm (1 nanometer = 10^-9 meter). There are other colors on the spectrum besides red and blue. Color perception is not universal among all living beings. The object in question is visible to the human eye. There are objects that can absorb or reflect shorter wavelengths of light. There is a process that determines which wavelengths are being absorbed. EM-waves are affected differently by different media. The object in question is capable of absorbing EM-waves. The particles were previously still. The frequency of light is crucial for the excitation of electrons in molecules or atoms. The object is solid and has a smooth surface. The object in question is made up of matter. The molecular and atomic structure of an object determines how light interacts with it. The object in question has a specific structure. Energy is always either transmitted or reflected. The molecules are interacting with a particular frequency of light.
 Music has a unique ability to trigger memories. Humans have a deep and complex relationship with music.
 Sperm production can occur without the presence of endogenous testosterone. GnRH is the only hormone responsible for testosterone release and sperm production. A healthy male can experience a natural upswing in testosterone. There are hormone pathways that regulate both testosterone and sperm production. There is a specific condition that must be met for this to apply. The hormone feedback loop and testes are prone to malfunction. Males with normal testosterone levels are not always fertile. Boosting exogenous testosterone levels has an effect on fertility. Hormone replacement therapy was previously considered part of a larger situation. The body's natural release of testosterone is significant for maintaining hormonal balance. The negative feedback cycle is a common occurrence in the body. Testosterone replacement therapy is commonly used. The male in question has a problem with their pituitary gland/hypothalamus.
