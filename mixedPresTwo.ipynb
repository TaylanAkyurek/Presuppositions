Differences in pressure relate to how air is moving vertically and how different areas interact with one another. Air pressure is affected by vertical movement. Different areas have varying levels of air pressure. The weather, of course, depends on a number of things... including the season and where other air masses are in relation to the one currently in your area. The season has a significant impact on the weather. The location of air masses affects the weather. We could associate \"High Pressure\" with pleasant weather, but that would only be fair to say during a warmer period of the year when cool, dry air would be a welcome relief in the face of hot or muggy conditions. High pressure is typically associated with unpleasant weather during cooler periods of the year. Cool, dry air is always a welcome relief in the face of hot or muggy conditions. High Pressure during the winter would bring cool, dry air during a period where it is already cold... which would aggravate that cold -- especially on a cloudless night, for example. The winter is already cold. High pressure would bring cool, dry air. As areas of high pressure meet with warmer, moist air that is associated with low pressure, you'll see opportunities for storms to develop. There are areas of high pressure and low pressure in the atmosphere. Warm, moist air is associated with low pressure. The central US is famous for this, with massive squall lines and numerous tornadoes due to the warm and cool air masses meeting. There are frequent weather disturbances in the central US. The squall lines and tornadoes are a common occurrence. A really great example of an area of low pressure forewarning \"crappy weather\" would be a Hurricane. There are areas of low pressure that can forewarn of \"crappy weather\" besides hurricanes. The \"crappy weather\" caused by low pressure areas can have varying degrees of severity. There are plenty of different types of storms and weather that air masses can influence. There are numerous air masses that can influence weather patterns. Different types of storms can be caused by these air masses. Wikipedia has some good reading on lows and the weather associated with them: _URL_0_ There is a significant amount of information available on lows and their associated weather patterns. The information can be found on Wikipedia.</td>\n",

The complexity of the human brain is often underestimated. The interconnectedness of the brain's systems is crucial to its functioning. To even design an implant that could work its way between the cells and connect to particular targeted neurons is well beyond the capability of current medicine. Current medicine has attempted to design an implant that can connect to targeted neurons. There is a need for an implant that can connect to targeted neurons. Then there's the problem that there's not even a consensus about how memories are actually stored in the brain, so even if you could hook up an implant to whatever neurons you wanted, we have no idea what cells to hook it up to. There is a significant lack of understanding about how memories are stored in the brain. The process of hooking up an implant to specific neurons is not yet fully understood. There are a few neural implants that exist, but they're mostly very crude, the equivalent of a \"brain pacemaker\" that zaps part of your brain to stave off seizures, or a link to a mechanical arm that allows some amount of crude motor control. Advanced neural implants have been developed that are highly sophisticated and can perform complex tasks. The majority of people have already received neural implants and they are considered a standard part of human anatomy. You're probably better off tapping into the brain's \"peripherals\", rather than trying to wire the brain itself. The brain has peripherals that can be tapped into. Wiring the brain itself is difficult or ineffective. Cochlear implants are some of the most sophisticated ones that are currently deployed, and they work well enough to allow deaf people to hear fairly well. Deaf people have a difficult time hearing without cochlear implants. Cochlear implants are the only solution for deaf people to hear. A similar but much more-sophisticated version of the same thing could probably be made for stimulating the retina. There is currently a method for stimulating the retina. The current method is not as sophisticated as the one mentioned in the sentence. On the \"output from the brain\" side of things, you can tap into motor neurons, translating from small motions to input to a computer. There is a device that can tap into motor neurons. Small motions can be translated into input to a computer.</td>\n",

But the dispersion of light from the moon (or any object) is dictated by the r^2 rule. Light dispersion is a common phenomenon. The r^2 rule is a well-known principle in physics. As you double the distance from an object, you receive 1/4 the light. The object in question emits a constant amount of light. The distance from the object is measurable. I grabbed some numbers to get an estimate of the power required to generate a barely visible dot on the moon:3.839*10^26 W * 37 / ((100^0.2)^6.5) * (385000km)^2 / (25 light years)^23.839*10^26 W : 1 solar luminosity37: the solar luminosity of vega (which has apparent brightness of 0)(100^0.2)^6.5): the ratio of vega's apparant luminosity to that of a barely visible star in perfect conditions 385000km : distance to the moon25 LY: distance to vegaResult: 95 MegaWattsSo presumably a 95 MW perfectly focused laser  on a black moon in perfect conditions would show a barely visible dot. 1. The technology to create a 95 MW laser capable of producing a barely visible dot on the moon exists. Things I didnt take into account:-stars emit light in a sphere (all directions, the moon reflects in a non-uniform semi-sphere) (this would lower the result)-The moon is not a prefect reflector (this would raise the result) The universe is full of stars that emit light in all directions, which affects the measurement of the result.

I have extensive knowledge on the topic at hand due to my recent completion of a project. The project I worked on was successful and yielded valuable results. It was a pilot study looking into the possibility of developing a prosthetic arm capable of giving amputees tactile feedback, so they can actually feel the objects they are touching. There is a high demand for prosthetic arms that can provide tactile feedback. The current prosthetic arms available do not provide tactile feedback. We generated synthetic neural inputs (through a lot of computational neuroscience that I won't go into as its very maths heavy and not relevant) and delivered these digital inputs to subjects as a pilot study. Neuroscientists have been working on creating synthetic neural inputs for a long time. The subjects who received the digital inputs were able to perform better on cognitive tasks. The subjects reported that the inputs felt nothing like anything they had previously felt. The subjects had previously felt something similar to the inputs. The inputs were expected to feel a certain way. There is currently work being done to improve these signals to create a more 'normal' sensation. There are signals that currently exist that do not create a 'normal' sensation. The work being done to improve these signals is being done by experts in the field. Try researching Paul Bach y rita, who has done a lot of work in this area. Paul Bach y rita is a well-known researcher in this area. There is a lot of research available on this topic. tl;dr: Stimulating neurons with stored digital signals creates a sensation unlike anything else, and research is being done to make it feel more normal. Digital signals can be stored in neurons. The sensation created by stimulating neurons with digital signals is not currently normal.</td>\n",

Believing in the nocebo effect can cause physical symptoms to manifest. The nocebo effect is more powerful than the placebo effect.

People who do not get a rash from being near a Wi-Fi router do not experience any visible symptoms. The rash caused by being near a Wi-Fi router is not contagious. It's not the Wi-Fi signal that's causing the rash, it's the belief. There is a rash present. The person in question believes that the rash is caused by something other than the Wi-Fi signal. Whether the same is true for the scenario you describe is hard to say. There is a scenario being discussed. The scenario being discussed is uncertain. I'm not aware of any studies, and I'm not convinced it could be tested in an ethical manner. There have been previous attempts to test the subject in question. The ethical implications of testing the subject are widely debated. It would entail convincing sick people to sign up to test what they believe to be entirely useless. Sick people are willing to participate in medical experiments. The medical experiments are believed to be entirely useless.</td>\n",

Albinism is caused by a malfunctioning gene that produces melanin, and since most species have melanin in their system, they do have the gene that codes for the synthesis of it. Melanin is essential for survival in most species. The malfunctioning gene that produces melanin is rare. Since apart from pigmentation, this gene doesn't exactly affect anything else, it's one of the few \"bad\" mutations, that actually allows the animal to survive and procreate with. This gene has been extensively studied and its effects on pigmentation are well-known. The animal in question has a unique survival advantage due to this gene. Sure it inhibits camouflage ability, it makes protection from the sun basically nonexistant, but apart from that everything else functions fine. The product being discussed is intended for outdoor use. The product is marketed as having multiple functions. Therefore, especially animals that live furter from the equator, where extreme sunlight isn't as big of a problem, these animals have a chance to survive and have offspring, which also enhances the probability of seeing an animal with albinism. Animals living closer to the equator have a lower chance of survival due to extreme sunlight. The probability of seeing an animal with albinism is higher in animals living further from the equator. It's in a way similar in polydactily, in that animals that have it can survive, just that it's way easier to spot a completelly white animal, than an individual that has 6 fingers on each limb. Animals with polydactyly are rare. Animals with white fur are more easily spotted than those with polydactyly.</td>\n",

These things run down the whole length of our muscle. They basically look like interlocking fingers. The \"fingers\", known as the thin and thick filaments\", are composed of proteins. Whenever our nervous system sends a message to contract a certain muscle (therefore the cells that comprise it), there's a sudden surge in calcium within the cells. This calcium essentially causes the \"fingers\" to interlock more through thick and thin filament interactions (the thick filament has proteins that actually \"walk\" across the thin filament).
