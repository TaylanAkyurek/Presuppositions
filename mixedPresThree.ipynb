The speaker may have a personal connection to the aside. Clinical trials are often presented as \"scientists do a double blind of their drug vs. sugar pill and see if the drug is better\". Scientists conducting clinical trials often use a double-blind method to test the effectiveness of their drugs against a placebo. Clinical trials are typically conducted with the goal of determining whether a drug is safe and effective for use in humans. The results of clinical trials are often subject to interpretation and may not always be conclusive. In reality, this kind of trial is done very very rarely, basically only for diseases that have no other treatment available. This kind of trial is not commonly done for diseases that have other treatment options available. The trial in question is experimental and has not been widely tested. The trial is only available to a select group of patients who meet specific criteria. Usually, a clinical trial is performed against the best strandard of care. The best standard of care is not always available. Clinical trials are not always performed against the best standard of care. The results of a clinical trial may not be applicable to all patients. So if there is a treatment in place already, patients will get either a new treatment or an existing one, or sometimes they may get existing treatment + new drug vs existing treatment + placebo, but no one will ever allow a trial where patients will get treatment that is worse in any way to the best standard of care they would get if they did not participate in the trial. There is a standard of care that patients receive if they do not participate in a trial. The treatments offered in a trial are either new or existing, with the possibility of a placebo. The safety and well-being of patients is a top priority in clinical trials. That would be unethical, and in most countries quite illegal. There is a specific action or behavior being considered. The action or behavior is being evaluated as potentially unethical and illegal in most countries. The speaker has some knowledge or understanding of the laws and ethical standards in different countries. As for testing contraceptives, the tests usually involve couples that are having sex, looking to not get pregnant, but are ok getting pregnant as well. Couples who participate in contraceptive testing are sexually active. The testing process involves both partners. The testing process is voluntary. For example,  couples that are ok having kids some time in the next 1-2 years, which means that if the contraceptive fails, they don't mind, but if it works, there is about a year worth of data of not getting pregnant before they switch off the contraceptive and have a child. 1. The couple in question has discussed and agreed upon their desire to have children in the near future.2. The couple has access to and is currently using contraception to prevent pregnancy until they are ready to have a child.3. The couple is aware of the potential risks and benefits of using contraception and has made an informed decision about their family planning. Then the couples are divided into groups depending on what form of contraception they use (or were going to use) so that no extra risk from their current behavior is added. Couples are engaging in risky behavior that needs to be mitigated. The couples have already chosen a form of contraception. The groups are determined based on the effectiveness of the chosen contraception method. Then some of the couples are asked to switch to the new contraceptive, some asked to maintain their current method, and some are asked to add the new contraceptive to their current method if applicable (e.g. There is a study or experiment being conducted on contraceptive methods for couples. The study has multiple groups, with some couples being asked to switch to a new contraceptive, some asked to maintain their current method, and some asked to add the new contraceptive to their current method if applicable. The study is being conducted by a reputable organization or institution. a couple that used condoms will now use condoms and take the pill). The couple has been using condoms before. The couple has decided to switch to taking the pill. The couple is concerned about their sexual health. This last case is where you can add a placebo as well such as condom + placebo vs. condom + pill and see the effect of the pill itself vs other effects such as increased awareness from having to take a pill. There is a study being conducted on the effects of a placebo in combination with a pill. The study is being conducted on individuals who are taking a pill for a specific condition. The study is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pill and the placebo in treating the condition. Note that in this case, unless the pill somehow specifically decreases effectiveness of condoms (unlikely), the placebo does not increase the risk of pregnancy to the couple since they are using condoms and if the trial did not happen, that was the method of contraception they were going to use anyway. The couple is using condoms as their primary method of contraception. The trial is not affecting their choice of contraception. The placebo is not affecting the effectiveness of the condoms. Just to add, these kinds of trials are done after a lot of other studies  assessing safety and efficacy are performed. Other studies assessing safety and efficacy have been performed before these trials.The trials being referred to are a common occurrence in the medical field.The trials being referred to have a high success rate due to the previous studies performed.</td>\n",

The conversion from Cartesian to polar coordinates is a well-established mathematical process. The use of ϕ as the angle variable is a convention in many mathematical fields. Or you could define every point that way from the start. There is a previous conversation or context where defining points was discussed. The speaker is suggesting an alternative approach to defining points. The current approach to defining points is not effective. But, this shows that there will always be an angle ϕ from [0,2π) that will pass through your (x,y) point, regardless of its value, so there will always be a ray that does so. There are infinite angles ϕ that can pass through any given (x,y) point. The existence of a ray passing through a point is not dependent on the value of ϕ.

The planet in question has been extensively studied and measured. The surface in question is used for scientific research. The dimensions of the surface have been calculated with great precision. The reference surface for large solid bodies with slow rotation (e.g. There are large solid bodies in the universe that rotate slowly. The reference surface for these bodies is important for understanding their behavior. The rotation of these bodies is affected by the reference surface they are on. Mercury, Venus) are often simply spheres with the average radius of the planet. There are other planets that are not simply spheres with the average radius. The average radius of Mercury and Venus is significantly different from other planets. The shape of Mercury and Venus is not affected by any external factors. For faster rotaters (Earth, Mars) an oblate spheroid is more appropriate. The Earth and Mars are both rotating faster than other planets. An oblate spheroid is the only shape that can accommodate the faster rotation. The current shape of Earth and Mars is not suitable for their faster rotation. This shape approximates the equatorial bulge caused by planet's rotational momentum. The planet in question has a significant rotational momentum. The equatorial bulge is a common phenomenon among planets with rotational momentum. The shape of the equatorial bulge is a reliable indicator of the planet's rotational momentum. For a *tidally locked* fast rotater (Io, Europa) an ellipsoid usually provides the best fit reference surface. There are celestial bodies that are tidally locked and rotate quickly. An ellipsoid is a common reference surface for these bodies. The ellipsoid provides the best fit for the reference surface. For the gas giants, the convention has been to define zero altitude to be the atmospheric depth at which the pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa). Gas giants have a unique atmospheric composition that requires a specific definition of zero altitude. The convention of defining zero altitude for gas giants has been in place for a long time. The definition of zero altitude for gas giants is crucial for accurate measurements and understanding of their atmosphere.</td>\n",

The materials used in batteries and remotes are limited to nickel and steel. The use of other materials is not possible. Nickel and steel are the only materials that can be used for the ends of batteries and terminals on remotes. In the atmosphere, both of these metals exist with an oxide film. There is an atmosphere present. Both metals are present in the atmosphere. The oxide film is a natural occurrence in the atmosphere. Even brand new, there is a thin layer of oxide on this metal. This metal is prone to oxidation. The metal has been exposed to air or moisture. The oxide layer is not harmful to the metal's function. It just comes with exposure to oxygen. Oxygen is necessary for the process to occur. The process is natural and cannot be stopped. Exposure to other elements will not produce the same result. Metal oxide is an insulator that electrons will not travel through. Metal oxide is a common material used in electronic devices. Metal oxide is a poor conductor of electricity. Metal oxide is often used as a coating to prevent electrical current from passing through. The only reason metal contacts work is that the oxide layer is small enough that either the electron can avoid the oxide atom or it can quantum tunnel through the layer. There is a significant problem with metal contacts not working properly. The oxide layer is typically too thick for electrons to pass through. The process of quantum tunneling is essential for metal contacts to function properly. The other thing going on here is a battery's charge changes as it is drained. A battery is being drained. The battery has a charge. The battery's charge is measurable. A rechargeable NiMH will be 1.4V when it is just charged, 1.2V through most of its life, and 1.1V when it is close to death. The battery is rechargeable. The battery has a lifespan. The battery voltage changes over time. Alkaline and heavy duty batteries are similar. There are other types of batteries that are significantly different from alkaline and heavy duty batteries. Alkaline and heavy duty batteries are commonly used in everyday devices. The similarities between alkaline and heavy duty batteries are based on their chemical composition. The thickness of oxide an electron can tunnel through is related to its voltage, so near death the oxide layer is thicker and the voltage is lower. There is a material with an oxide layer that can conduct electricity. The thickness of the oxide layer affects the voltage of the material. The material experiences a decrease in voltage as it approaches the end of its lifespan. When you rotate the battery, you remove some, but not all, of the oxide layer and allow new paths to go through and this gives you just a bit longer battery life. The battery has an oxide layer. Rotating the battery is necessary for longer battery life. The oxide layer is the main factor affecting battery life.</td>\n",

It's entirely possible that Neanderthals were smarter and stronger and in every sense \"better\" than modern humans. Modern humans are generally considered to be the most intelligent and physically capable species on Earth. The idea that Neanderthals were superior in any way challenges widely accepted beliefs about human evolution. There is evidence to suggest that Neanderthals and modern humans coexisted and may have even interbred, which could have influenced the development of both species. In fact, if you put a Neanderthal into the modern world right now, *it's possible that they'd be super-athletic geniuses with red hair and fair skin*. Neanderthals had physical abilities that modern humans do not possess. Neanderthals had a unique genetic makeup that allowed them to excel in athletics. Neanderthals had a distinct appearance with red hair and fair skin. When it comes down to it, modern humans didn't have to beat Neanderthals in any direct competition. Modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted at some point in history. Modern humans were aware of the existence of Neanderthals. Modern humans had some form of interaction with Neanderthals. They simply had to out-breed them. There was a competition between two groups. One group had a higher birth rate than the other. The group with the higher birth rate won the competition by out-breeding the other group. It could be as simple as reproduction rates. Reproduction rates are a significant factor in the situation being discussed. The situation being discussed involves some sort of biological or ecological system. The simplicity of the reproduction rates suggests that there are other, more complex factors at play in the situation. Perhaps Neanderthals only had a couple kids that they raised very well while modern humans were basically trailer-trash, kid-spawners. Neanderthals and modern humans had different parenting styles. Neanderthals prioritized quality over quantity when it came to raising children. Modern humans had a higher birth rate but were less attentive to their children's upbringing. The sentence implies that Neanderthals and modern humans coexisted at some point in time. The sentence suggests that there may have been a societal hierarchy in which Neanderthals were considered superior parents to modern humans.</td>\n",

Whenever our nervous system sends a message to contract a certain muscle (therefore the cells that comprise it), there's a sudden surge in calcium within the cells.
